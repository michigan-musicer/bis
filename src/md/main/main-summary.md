This project is a series of interviews collected from 42 current undergraduates, graduate students, and alumni from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor about their experiences with burnout and IS (imposter syndrome). This project was completed between the months of May and July of 2022.

The main purpose of *Brilliant Little Fires* is to provide personal stories about burnout and imposter syndrome, particularly for college students who may be struggling with these feelings. Burnout and imposter syndrome became more prominent topics in the news in light of the COVID-19 pandemic **CITE**, and psychology researchers are exploring both topics in the academic literature **CITE**. However, when I experienced these things, I had a hard time finding collections of personal stories that I could personally relate to. My hope is that this project can remedy that to some extent.

Because the main purpose of this project is to provide personal stories, I encourage you to [read at least one or two interviews](#interviews) **CHANGE HYPERLINK COLOR**. I understand, though, that not everyone will have the time, so I've compiled [a shorter list of observations as well](#observations).

<!-- Burnout and IS were prevalent among interviewees, but it's problematic put this into numbers. See "Observations" for fuller qualitative analysis and explanation of quantitative difficulties.</p>  -->
<!-- {/* <p><b>Be skeptical of these figures.</b> One, my sample size is small and isn't representative of the student population. Two, a student saying they experienced burnout or IS doesn't mean that a mental health expert would agree. In particular with burnout, there seems to be both short-term, temporary burnout and long-term, more serious burnout, which I've attempted to separate.</p> */} -->
