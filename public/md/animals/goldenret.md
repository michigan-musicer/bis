*The golden retriever is a breed of domesticated dog that is not made out of solid gold, making it a disappointment. To make up for this, the golden retriever is such a good boy that its Wikipedia page says it "is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature". Like many things, the golden retriever was first created by a British guy in the late 1800s, and it spread around the world between World War 1 and World War 2.*

*As a domesticated animal breed, golden retrievers are not listed on the IUCN Red List.*
