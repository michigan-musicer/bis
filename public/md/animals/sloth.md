*Hoffman's two-toed sloth is different from most of the other sloths in having two toes instead of three, and it's different from the other two-toed sloth because it's named after a guy named Hoffman instead of a guy named Linnaeus. The animal sloth was discovered after whoever came up with the seven sins called one of them sloth; apparently, they are so slow and lazy that some biologist decided they were religiously offensive. Sloths develop algae in their fur, which actually helps them with camoflauge, providing nutrients, and surrounding them with "sloth moths" who feed on the algae. Think of a Disney princess surrounded by butterflies, except the butterflies are moths and the princess has no motivation to do anything.*

*Hoffman's two-toed sloth is considered least concern on the IUCN Red List.*
