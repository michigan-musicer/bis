*The Alaskan moose is also known as the giant moose, just like Alaksa, or the Yukon moose by Canadians (in which case the giant moose thing doesn't work as well - the Yukon is the 9th largest Canadian territory out of 13 provinces and territories). Alaskan moose can be over 2 meters tall in terms of shoulder height, as well as weigh over 1,400 pounds. Thankfully, moose do not care about eating humans, instead choosing to eat a little over 70 pounds of shrubs and bits from trees to survive every day.*

*The Alaskan Moose is listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List.*
