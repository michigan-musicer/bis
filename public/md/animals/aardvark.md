*The aardvark is the last living species in the order* Orycteropodidae, *which is a roundabout way of calling it weird. Think of it as a mix between an anteater and a pig: it sniffs out insects with its snout, then digs them out with its front paws and licks them up. They also forage for a fruit named after them: the aardvark cucumber, an underground cucumber/melon thing that requires feeding aardvarks to spread seeds.*  

*The aardvark is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.*
