*The sea otter is a mammal that lives on both sides of the northern Pacific Ocean. They are a prime example of a keystone species, as they are one of the main predators of sea urchins that would otherwise destroy kelp ecosystems. Like many important animals, humans almost hunted sea otters to extinction for their fur, reducing the world population to less than 2,000 at one point. The sea otter has recovered to about 2/3 of its former range, and this recovery is one of the biggest successes in wildlife conservation efforts.*

*The sea otter is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.*
