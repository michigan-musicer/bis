*The European hamster is a wild hamster with brown fur, white patches, and a black belly. It is also known as the common hamster, which is a very unfortunate name for a critically endangered animal. The European hamster is much larger than other wild variants of hamster (e.g. Syrian or dwarf hamsters) and eats mostly vegetables. Many of these vegetables are vegetables that humans are trying to grow, which in the past led to it getting shot a lot.*

*As mentioned, the European hamster is critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.*
