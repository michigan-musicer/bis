*The koala is an Australian marsupial and the only survivor of its biological family; its closest relative is the wombat, a fact which the koala prefers to ignore. Koalas have somehow managed to choose the least nutritious leaves ever: the eucalyptus leaf is the majority of a koala's diet. Due to the lack of nutrition in this diet, koalas sleep 20 hours a day, which is what I'm going to do after I publish this project. Also like me, koalas have scent glands on their chest, and they use secretions from those glands to mark their presence for others of their species.*

*The koala is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.*
