*The snowy owl lives in the Arctic, mostly in tundra regions. It is the only owl that has mostly white feathers, and it also hunts in the day unlike most other owls. Along with Disney producers, the snowy owl is specialized with hunting lemmings (small rodents that also live in the Arctic tundra). Since they live in the cold where no one else wants to be, there isn't a lot of data about the snowy owl today. Scientists think that global warming is having a particularly negative effect on the snowy owl's lifecycle.*

*The snowy owl is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.*
