*The Asian elephant is one of three living species of elephant. Asian elephants occur most on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Elephants are perhaps most interesting for their intelligence; their neocortex is particularly large, similar to that of humans, apes, and some dolphins. In ancient times, elephants were tamed and used by humans for work, war, and transportation. The warlord Tamerlane once turned an army of elephants against the Sultan of Delhi by driving flaming camels towards them; the elephants turned around in fear and stampeded the sultan's army.*

*The Asian elephant is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.*
