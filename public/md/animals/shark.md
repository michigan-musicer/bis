*The basking shark is the shark that all the children's book authors skip over in favor of the whale shark. I am not a children's book author, so I will give the basking shark its due time of day. The basking shark is the second-largest living shark and the second-largest of the plankton-seating large sharks, both of the first-place positions in this case being taken by the whale shark. Like the whale shark, the basking shark uses gills instead of teeth to basically filter the water of plankton and eat them - they don't seem to eat other things.*

*The basking shark is considered endangered on the IUCN Red List.*
