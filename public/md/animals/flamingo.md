*Flamingos are, surprisingly, not just plastic lawn decorations. They are large birds with six extant species, two in Afro-Eurasia and four in the Americas. Oddly enough, flamingos were considered prize birds at the dinner table in ancient Roman cuisine. Flamingos will often stand on one leg and tuck in the other one below their body, which scientists are still confused about. On the subject of scientists: in a rare case of scientists being good at naming things, a group of flamingoes is called a flamboyance.

*The Andean flamingo, shown here, is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.*
