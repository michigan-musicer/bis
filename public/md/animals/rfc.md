*The Atlantic royal flycatcher is one of four royal flycatchers, all of whom are very clique-y and snobbish towards the rest of the fly-catching species of the world. This particular species of flycatcher resides in the southeast of Brazil, where true to its name, it eats flies. Notably, the Atlantic royal flycatcher's nest is a long and narrow thing usually hanging from a branch or vine. If you've ever seen one of those homes designed by weirdo professional architects, you kind of get the vibe of a royal flycatcher's nest.*

*The Atlantic royal flycatcher is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.*
