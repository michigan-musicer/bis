*The giraffe is the tallest terrestrial animal on Earth. Giraffes are generally pretty extroverted and travel around in herds across Africa. When attacked, giraffes have a habit of kicking and occasionally decapitating their predators. This has caused considerable consternation among their predators, who are not used to getting decapitated by the things they want to eat.*

*Rothschild's giraffe is pictured here, and it is lsited as near threatened on the IUCN Red List.*
