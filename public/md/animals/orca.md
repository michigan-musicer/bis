*The orca is the largest oceanic dolphin, with a distinct black-and-white body color. It's often taught that "killer whale" is a misnomer for the orca, since it is a dolphin and not a whale; technically, you can weasel your way into justifying this because dolphins are classified as toothed whales. While orcas are not deadly to humans, they are strong enough and crazy enough to hunt great white sharks and* succeed. *Frequently, orcas will just eat the livers off of great white sharks; two orcas killed at least eight great whites off the coast of South Africa since 2017, leaving seven carcasses to wash up on shore without livers.*

*The orca is data deficient in the IUCN Red List - we do not know how threatened they are.*
