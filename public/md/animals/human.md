*While not the most numerically prominent species on Earth, humans are currently the dominant species on the planet. Originating from Africa, humans spread everywhere like the milk you pour in your cereal at 8:00 AM when you're half-awake and can't aim the container into your bowl, and just like spilled milk does to you with your addled morning brain, humans proceeded to make God cry. Every interviewee of this project is actually a human, including this smart aleck who said "human" as their first option when I asked them what animals they wanted for their avatar.*

*Humans do not list themselves on the IUCN Red List, although recent trends suggest maybe they should.*
