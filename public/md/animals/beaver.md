*The Eurasian beaver is kind of like the North American beaver but with slightly different fur, a larger head, and 8 more chromosomes. Beavers in Eurasia were hunted for fur (which many American students learn in school) and castoreum, a yellow secretion from "castor sacs" near the beaver's butt (which many American students do not learn in school). The beaver population in Eurasia was reduced to only a little over 1,000 when we reached the 20th century, but conservation efforts have allowed it to recover since - allowing me to teach you that we still use stuff from beaver butts in perfume.*

*The Eurasian beaver is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.*
