*The jaguar is of the genus* panthera *that also includes lions, tigers, and leopards. The jaguar is the only one of this genus native to the Americas. Scientists believe that the jaguar probably copied the human strat and crossed over the land bridge that temporarily connected Alaska to Eurasia a really, really long time ago, before Alaska was called Alaska. Jaguars used to occupy Argentina all the way to the south of Texas (which also wasn't called Texas when jaguars came to the Americas), but due to hunting and habitat loss they are mostly restricted to the north of South America.*

*Jaguars are near threatened on the IUCN Red List.*
