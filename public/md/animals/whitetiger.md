*Tigers are large cats of the* panthera *genus similar to lions, jaguars, and leopards. Whtie tigers are in the same species, but they lack a pigment in their fur called pheomelanin that is responsible for red and yellow tints. Besides the color change, white tigers seem to also grow faster and heavier than normal tigers. For an even rarer kind of tiger, look for a white tiger without stripes: this can be caused by an additional genetic condition, and it occasionally shows up in orange tigers too.*

*Tigers are endangered on the IUCN Red List.*
