*When it comes to bears, there is a common saying: "If it's black, fight back. If it's brown, lay down. If it's white, goodnight." This interviewee chose the grizzly bear, which going off of the saying is not as deadly as the polar bear but is still not a guest you want on a camping trip. Grizzly bears are considered a subspecies of the brown bear in North America, and they feed on pretty much everything: plants, nuts, large mammals, fish, birds, bird eggs, stuff in garbage bins, you name it.*

*Brown bears are listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.*
