*The chicken is a domesticated bird that is raised primarily for its meat and its unfertilized children (kinda screwed up when you think about it). Chickens were apparently first domesticated for cockfighting and other ceremonial events; thankfully, someone eventually discovered how they taste. There are more than 24 billion chickens around world, meaning that if they rebel against humanity we all need to take down at least 3 each. The chance of this is thankfully pretty low based on the size of a chicken's brain.*

*It comes as no surprise that chickens are not even listed on the IUCN Red List.*
