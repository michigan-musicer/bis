*The sugar glider is a very small type of possum in Australia, which confusingly is not the same type of animal as the opossum over in the Americas. It itself is not made of sugar, but it likes to eat sap and nectar, and it can glide through the air with what are essentially wings formed by the legs. The sugar glider does its gliding at night, relying on big eyes and ears that can swivel independently from the head to locate objects in the dark. The sugar glider seems a lot less cool in Australia than it would be anywhere else because Australia has all the cool animals, including other gliding possums like the feathertail glider, greater glider, etcetera.*

*The sugar glider is least concern on the IUCN Red List.*
