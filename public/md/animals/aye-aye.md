*It may not be obvious, but the aye-aye is a type of monkey, specifically a lemur. Besides being the largest nocturnal primate and severely confusing all the biologists who first discovered it, the aye-aye is distinctive for having an unusually long and thin middle finger (visible in the portrait photo on the left hand). The aye-aye will chew a hole in tree bark and then use this finger to scoop out invertebrates inside the tree bark, essentially giving it the job of a hairy flightless woodpecker. The only other animal to feed in a similar way is the striped possum, which has an unusually long and thin* fourth *finger instead.*

*Lemurs are among the most endangered mammals in the world, and the aye-aye is classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List.*
