*The Maine Coon is one of the oldest and largest natural breeds of domesticated cat in North America. It is the state cat of Maine, mostly because the only other things that anyone ever remembers coming out of Maine are lobsters and George H.W. Bush. The sociability of the Maine Coon has led to it being nicknamed "the gentle giant" among cats. Animal medical professionals have noted that the size of the Maine Coon may lead to particular health problems that don't come up as frequently in smaller breeds.*

*As a domesticated cat breed, the Maine Coon is not on the IUCN Red List*.
