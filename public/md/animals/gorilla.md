*The mountain gorilla is a subspecies of eastern gorilla - eastern here meaning East Africa in Rwanda, Uganda, and the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The last count on Wikipedia says they have more than 1,000 individuals, although whether this still holds today is a question. Mountain gorillas have thicker fur to enable them to survive colder temperatures (like those you would find on a mountain). They will walk around on all fours most of the time, but sometimes they drop the act and go climb trees to eat fruits.*

*The mountain gorilla is endangered on the IUCN Red List.*
