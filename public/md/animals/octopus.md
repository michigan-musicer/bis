*The coconut octopus is named for making defensive shelters out of coconut shells and other shells that it finds on the sea floor. It also has the ability to walk on two "feet", "feet" really being tentacles in this case. This suggests to scientists that the coconut octopus is particularly intelligent among octopi, which is a little worrying because octopi already showcase some of the most intelligence out of any invertebrate on planet Earth.*

*The coconut octopus is, to my knowledge, not listed on the IUCN Red List.*
