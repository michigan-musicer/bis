*Shown here is an Amazon river dolphin, which contrary to its name has subspecies in the Amazon basin, the Madeira River in Bolivia, and the Orinoco basin. They are also called pink river dolphins due to a slight pink shade - this results from their natural dark grey skin slowly peeling off over time. Like other dolphins, the Amazon river dolphin is a terrifying beast of nature that most humans think of too cutely - this particular species eats catfish, piranhas, river turtles, and other things that I would lose to in an underwater fight.*

*The Amazon river dolphin is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.*
