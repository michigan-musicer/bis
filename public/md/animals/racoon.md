*The racoon is native to North America and is often called the trash panda for its tendency to rummage in garbage bins for food. They have a distinct mask-like fur pattern on their face as well as a very strong sense of touch. Regional subspecies, like the Torch Key racoon in Florida, do look distinct from this typical look. The European Union considers the racoon an invasive species that should not be transported or released in Europe.*

*The racoon is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.*
