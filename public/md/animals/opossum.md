*It may not look like it, but pictured here is a gray slender opossum, native to Brazil. This particular species of opossum spends only about 2/3 of its time on the ground, spending the rest of it climbing trees. Opossums in general are marsupials in the Americas that usually look like big rats more than anything. Perhaps their most famous feature is the ability to play dead, which frequently results in them becoming actually dead when they do it out in the road.*

*The gray slender opossum is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.*
