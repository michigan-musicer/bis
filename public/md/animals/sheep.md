*The bighorn sheep is a North American species of wild sheep that crossed over to North America via the land bridge over the Bering Strait. The distinctive horns weigh up to 30 pounds, equivalent to 3 to 5 human infants. Bighorn sheep were originally concentrated around the Rocky mountains and the Sierra Nevada; they peaked at at least 1 million individuals and were known to local native American tribes. With the introduction of European livestock and in particular the diseases those livestock bore, bighorn sheep levels fell down to a few thousand by the turn of the 20th century. The population has since been recovering.*

*The bighorn sheep is considered least concern on the IUCN Red List.*
