This is essentially a walkthrough of how I did my interviews and, for some questions, why I chose the questions I chose. Probing questions about burnout and IS were largely based on the [International Classification of Diseases definition](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases) for the former and Clance's six characteristics of the imposter phenomenon for the latter ([publicly viewable reference on pages 79-81 here](https://so06.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/IJBS/article/view/521)). This second reference is admittedly not very good - I will try to track down Clance's 1985 paper at a later point.

## Preamble:
- There are a lot of questions! We may take longer or shorter than an hour depending on how in-depth your answers are. I’ve seen a range of 20 to 80 minutes with an average around 45 minutes.

This of course was adjusted as I got a better feel for how long most interviews took.

- This meeting will be recorded to make it easier for me to get the transcript. I will not share the recording, and if you would like I can make sure to delete the recording after getting the transcript.
    - I will be running the recording through a transcription service provided by Rev.ai. 

I made a note about Rev.ai because this is technically using the raw recording data and I wanted to make sure interviewees were okay with that. [Rev.ai as an organization is HIPAA-compliant](https://www.rev.ai/security), so all interviewees were fine with this. 

- Your answers will be anonymous.
- You will be asked specifically about your experience at UofM (for alumni), but please feel free to bring up other experiences if they are relevant.
- Many of these questions will be sensitive. Please feel free to decline to answer a question if it makes you feel uncomfortable.

I was surprised how willing interviewees were to talk about their experiences. I heard many sensitive stories and I don't think anyone skipped over a question because they were too afraid to get into it. There were details that interviewees later asked me to remove for privacy concerns; all of these requests I accepted.

- There will be an optional demographic survey at the end of this interview. This is used to aggregate population statistics and optionally add further context to your individual story.

## Intro:

**What is your age?**



**What school within Michigan are you in / did you graduate from?**

**What is your academic standing?**

I divided this into PhD candidate, PhD precandidate, master's, and undergraduate senior/junior/sophomore (rising if appropriate). If a student attended UofM for multiple degrees, I listed them all out separated by semicolons.

**What is / was your major(s and minors) at UofM?**

In the end, this was called "program" instead of major / minor because the latter wording isn't as good for describing graduate programs.

## Warmup:

**Tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**

I was curious how much people would have to say about this - I fully expected some students to say "Well, I went to high school, what else do you want?" and other students to start going about their high school experience and how it impacted their college situations. The results seem to confirm my expectations.

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM (whatever “peers” might mean to you)?**

This was a strange question because it doesn't tell me much if a student calls the entirety of their grade their peers and says they have 4,000 peers. What's interesting to look for here is basically how big a student's support network is and how that relates to their relationship with burnout and IS.

Going back, I would revise this and explicitly say "friends" or "friends and academic colleagues".

**How many years have you been / were you in your major?**

Useful when talking with interviewees who have done major changes.

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**

Both of these questions were intended to let the interviewee settle in and start getting some interesting details about their time at Michigan. I'd note that I could often get a feeling for what the tone of the interview would be based on the nature of the stories that were told - if failures or stressful moments were the most memorable stories, I could anticipate a more difficult experience with burnout and IS coming up.

[Hamster](/interview/hamster)'s interview was exceptional because the memorable story became very sensitive and eventually, something that would be dangerous to publish. Our solution was simple: excise the story and acknowledge in [editor's note text] that it was important.

## Probing:

### Burnout:

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**

Average is a questionable measurement to take here because it doesn't capture variance in working hours. Many students reported a normal-ish looking average that would then spike up significantly around project or paper deadlines. If you want a number, though, I'm not sure what else you could do - maybe hours over a month? But it's already hard for many interviewees to remember accurate time estimates for working hours.

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you get per week in an average semester?**

Waking rest refers to rest taken during the day or whenever the interviewee is awake, and the reason I specify waking rest is to see whether or not students were mentally taking breaks. Taking time during the day to not think about work is one important aspect of this. Sleep *does* do this as well, though, so I think a separate question for sleep would have been nice (though it might have started to bloat the amount of questions).

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week that semester?**

Repeat of above questions for busiest semester. Essentially looking for interesting behavior in outliers.

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**

Same idea, but now concentrated in one week.

**Can you walk me through that week (or an example of one of those weeks)?**

Many interviewees were walking me through their semesters already for the previous question unprompted. This is a good question still to make sure that all students were giving me some details.

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**

Lack of control isn't a symptom of burnout according to the ICD definition, but I figured it was at least a related element.

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**

References first condition from ICD:
>  feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion;

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**

References second condition from ICD:
>  increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; 

**Did you have a change in trend of academic results since you began attending UofM?**

References third condition from ICD:
>  reduced professional efficacy.

### IS:

**When you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**

Relates to Clance's first condition of imposter phenomenon (IP), participation in the imposter cycle. According to the paper cited above, this is a cycle of approaching an "achievement-related task", worrying about it, overpreparing to get it done or procrastinating, a temporary feeling of relief, discounting positive feedback, and eventually increasing feelings of self-doubt and fradulence.

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a “best” or especially strong student? If so, how?**

References Clance's second IP condition, the need to be special. I wanted to ask this about high school because I was curious to see if students who answered "yes" to this had this "need to be special" arise at the start of college.

**Do you / did you feel pressure to be “superhuman” at UofM? If so, how?**

Clance's third IP condition, superhuman aspects. Really, this comes down to perfectionism.

**What is your relationship with failure?**

Clance's fourth IP condition, fear of failure. Keeping it open-ended to avoid suggesting anything to interviewees.

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**

Clance's fifth IP condition, denial of / discounting praise, again formatted in an open-ended manner. 

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**

Clance's sixth IP condition, fear and guilt about success, again formatted in an open-ended manner. Notably, I don't think anyone cited these specific feelings about their successes - at most self-doubt similar to something from the question directly above.

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**

Not based on Clance's 1985 work, but instead inspired by reading up on "tall poppy syndrome", a phenomenon in which other people "pull down" high performers out of jealousy or envy. While not directly related to imposter syndrome, I figured it might be a relevant factor.

## Core:

**Have you heard the term “burnout” before?**

**If so, how would you define burnout in your own words?**

**Have you heard the term “imposter syndrome” or something similar before?**

**If so, how would you define that in your own words?**

**Do you believe you’ve ever experienced burnout?**

**Do you believe you’ve ever experienced imposter syndrome?**

The two "experienced" questions could have been expanded on to ask about the degree of burnout and IS, which would have painted a more complete picture.

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and IS?**

## Closing:

**Considering everything we’ve talked about today, do you / did you enjoy your academic work?**

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice (if any) would you give regarding imposter syndrome / burnout?**

**Anything else you’d like to say?**

## Demographics:

In general, note that most questions are written as "What would you identify as..." or "What would you say...". This is best practice so that interviewees don't feel like they have to slot themselves into predefined boxes.

**Would you like this survey to be attached to your interview?**

I told students the default option was to opt out of this, for privacy reasons. Ultimately it was up to each individual student.

**What is / was your GPA?**

Proxy for level of performance among this student sample. This isn't a normal demographic question, but I'm glad I included it because it shows that I interviewed a relatively high-achieving group.

**What is / was your student residency status according to UofM?**

**For international students: what would you call your country of origin?**

This question ends up being non-inclusive of students who were born in another country, immigrated to the United States, and became citizens who would be classified as in-state or out-of-state. This confused some students filling out the form and just leaves out something that was often an important detail.

Ultimately, I couldn't really draw a lot of overarching conclusions based on international students coming from one country or another. There's too little data to say anything confidently.

**Are / were you a transfer student to UofM?**

All previous institutions were covered up as part of anonymization.

**Do you identify as a veteran or active member of the U.S. Armed Forces, Reserves, or National Guard?**

Notably, no one who filled out the survey did.

**Before coming to college, which social class group would you have identified with?**

**Did either of your parents complete a four-year college degree or higher?**

Asking about first-gen.

**What is your preferred religious identification?**

**How would you describe your ethnicity?**

**How would you describe your gender identity?**

**Do you consider yourself to be:**

Proceeded to list out sexual orientations (plus a fill-in-the-blank option). There's really no reason for the weasel wording here.
