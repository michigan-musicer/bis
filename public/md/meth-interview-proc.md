## Reaching out and scheduling

I mostly found interviewees by reaching out to friends and colleagues within my academic network. Obviously this is a problem because it means I am not drawing a random sample, but seeing as to how I wasn't trying to write an actual paper anyway, I felt like this was fine.

The email of project details that I sent was a 200-word thing about the goals of the project (provide personal stories of burnout and imposter syndrome to the public, particularly students) and how their interviews would be used (full edited transcripts with anonymization). Some of these details I filled in along the way as I realized what people were concerned about, which meant some circling back and asking people if they were okay with this or that specific thing I wanted to do. 

Most interviews took place either on weekends or after my working hours on weekdays.

## Interview preamble

[See here](/meth-questions) for the full preamble text, but I spent 5 minutes or so going over procedure one last time before interviewing to make sure there were no misunderstandings. Sometimes there were and we talked them through, which was of course fine.

## During interview

Basically what I told myself: don't get too emotionally invested in what's being said, but also don't be a rock. Try to have a dynamic conversation that doesn't necessarily fit the script 100%. You should just be a question machine, don't put yourself in there and avoid bringing up your own experiences even if prompted by your interviewee.

I had some fun with some interviews that were with closer friends who weren't talking about severe experiences, but in general, given the nature of the questions, I did my best to take these interviews seriously.

## Interview followup

Demographic survey was sent immediately following interviews; there was no expectation that interviewees would fill it out, so I am pleased at my response rate there. I also debriefed them on details I would anonymize and asked them what they wanted left out; and at this point I asked for three animals for their profile picture.

I decided to send all interviewees their edited transcripts and get a thumbs-up from them before posting them - mostly with respect to privacy details. This results in the project having two interviews currently pending thumbs-up, but I think it's worth it just for peace of mind and CYA for everyone involved.
