**To start out, tell me a little bit about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Uh, wait, would you mind clarifying the question a little bit?  

**Yeah. So tell me what schooling you had before you started freshman year.**   

Gotcha. I mean, I'm an international student. I was in China until 2017, which was when I came to the US for college. And then prior to that, I basically went through the typical Chinese school setting up to grade...11.

Yeah. I completed grade 11. So a bit of background: in China, middle school is up to grade nine, and high school is supposed to be like three years from grade 10 to grade 12. But I did two years of high school, and then I transferred to an international school. I studied IB over there I think for two years and came to UofM. So that's kind of the story.  

**Okay. Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Okay. Interesting. I mean, it really depends. If you mean a small group of friends, then probably I would say eight to 10, somewhere along that line. If you are talking about number of students or kind of acquaintances, I think the number would be like 30-ish. If it's also including the people who I vaguely know from classes and stuff, like then probably like a hundred. Yeah. 

**Okay. How many years were you in your major?**  

Uh, you mean for my current major? 

**For undergrad, between declaring and graduating.**

Okay. So for cognitive science, I think I declared it sometime in my freshman year, I think around winter break freshman year time. And I think for data science, I declared it at the beginning of my second semester sophomore year. So yeah, you do the mathematics.  

**Alright, I can probably do that. What is the story of you deciding on your two majors in undergrad?**  

So for cognitive science, I heard about it before coming to college, so - I mean, it's a long story. I, I was just like, "Okay, what will you major in for college?" And I was interested in psychology-related stuff, but then, well, I'm an international student. So at that time, I was thinking about getting a STEM major so I could get an OPT extension [refers to [Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-extension-for-stem-students-stem-opt), a government form that gives a 24-month extension for international students to train in STEM "practical training"], but then - I didn't use my undergrad OPT anyway, but at that time, that was one of the decision criteria. So psychology was apparently, like, at least at UofM it's a BA major. So I was like, "Probably not, no". So I'm thinking, "What's the closest thing, anything?", so I picked cognitive science. And as for data science - I took a few stats classes, and then...Opportunity Hub coaches had a field conversation with my friends, and it seemed that it was going to make myself a stronger candidate in the job market. 

Yeah, I would say back in the time I declared a major, it was just mostly for practical reasons. But then I would say looking back from now as a grad student, I'm actually more passionate and also more grateful for the educational experience I've had at UofM.

**Okay. I'll go ahead and backtrack a little bit: how many years have you been in grad school?**  

One year.  

**And what's the story of you deciding on grad school?**  

So I'm in the AMDP program, accelerated master's degree program. So technically speaking, it's four plus one - four years of undergrad plus one year of grad school. I decided to stay for an additional semester just because I want to, like, get a certificate in innovation and entrepreneurship. And apparently for that I need a bit more time to take classes. I guess my major, applied statistics - to be really honest, I don't like it that much just because although it's called applied statistics, it's not as applied as I thought it would be. Actually one big struggle I had as an undergrad was that a lot of my classes were really theoretical, so they ask you to derive formulas, prove theorems - I mean, that's cool. But I don't plan to pursue a PhD in statistics or computer science or data science or anything along that line. So I would say rather than learning the theoretical part, I would like to know how to apply what I learned in school to work. Yeah. 

So looking back from now, I should have considered like, school of information programs, but then like...yeah. Anyway, I wouldn't regret coming into grad school anyways, just because during the grad school time, I got to explore a few other classes outside of my degree program, and also things other than classes and stuff. Like I got to work with a few student initiatives I'm interested in.  

And also I've been working on an entrepreneurial project with a friend, and also without coming to grad school, I wouldn't be able to participate in ELP, the entrepreneurship leadership program. So yeah, I would say by staying for 1.5 more years at UofM, I'm actually exposed to more opportunities. And then also just because now I'm older, I have a better idea regarding what to do after graduation. I still haven't fully decided, but then I'd say the good thing is at least now I feel like I'm more determined about whatever path I choose. I say one good part is that previously, back at the time I was an undergrad, I would panic if the path I'm choosing was not a typical career path other students of my major would choose.  

But now I'm like, "well, they do whatever that's best for them. I know what are my personal values, I know what type of work experience I want to gain, I kind of know what I want to do in the next three to five years". And then also, I would say just, I find harmony. <laugh> That might sound cheesy, but I kind of feel - I feel comfortable about sticking to the choice I make and just standing up to my values. Things along that line, anyway. 

**What is one of your most memorable stories about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Uh, huh, let me think. I'd say just like taking a bunch of really random classes. I really appreciate the liberal arts education at UofM, and I definitely took quite a few classes where the class content had nothing to do with my major, I will never use that for the rest of my life - but just learning for the sake of, just kind of like, being curious about the subject and doing the exploration. I took a class - I believe it's called ancient studies or something like that? - where we were looking at the tablets and ancient Greek and we also looked at a bunch of amulets and, like, Egypt; and then we went to the school library, we went to the archeology museum, we were like looking at, we looked at stuff they had in the storage room. And I was just impressed by how, I would say basically getting exposure to things that I would probably not be aware of in my day to day life. There are a lot of other examples, but I guess I just use that class as an example. 

**Mm-hmm. What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in an average semester?**  

When you say work, do you mean schoolwork or...?  

**Yeah. Well, you can include other kinds of work too.**

Gotcha. Do you mean for undergrad or nowadays?  

**Uh, tell me both.**  

Okay, cool. So for undergrad, I would say freshman year...I don't recall much from freshman year. I would say for my sophomore year and first semester junior year, before COVID hit, I would spend around, let's say somewhere between...40 and 50 hours for academic related stuff. And I was also actively involved in quite a few student organizations, I also did volunteer work over the weekend, I worked as a resident advisor...so although technically speaking RAs have 20 hours of work, I would say in general I spent somewhere around 10 hours in total. Yeah. So that was kind of it. And after COVID, since I didn't have the RA job - I just resigned to be honest! UofM housing didn't do a really good job supporting its staff. So I resigned, moved to a friend's place, and...actually, I would say without having to commute to classes, and without having to show up to all those different student organizations, I actually got a lot more free time. So I'd say in terms of academics - and I just watched recordings double speed! - ranged somewhere around 30 to 40 hours per week. And then in terms of other commitments...I remember taking a few LinkedIn learning courses, I remember just picking up on a bunch of hobbies I had earlier, like writing and also drawing...yeah. Things along that line. 

And for grad school - I've been working as GSI for the past two semesters, and in general, GSI-ing would be somewhere between - so the first semester, I would say approximately 10 hours commitment per week; second semester, it's around 15 hours commitment per week. As grad students, you are taking fewer classes, so I would say approximately 20 to 30 hours of academic work per week, but then I've been involved in a bunch of external - I won't call it external opportunities, maybe. So I've been working on entrepreneurial projects, where anything I'm working on kind of, like - so this semester I've been working, pro bono, on a stats consulting project. So just a bunch of random things I've been doing, and also, well, I spent a lot of time like looking for summer internships or doing professional development-related stuff. But to be honest, I would say I have more control over my schedule nowadays as a grad student.  

**I just wanna make sure: for sophomore and first semester junior year, it was 40 to 50 hours?** 

Mm-hmm.

**And then during the pandemic, it was.**..  

30 to 40. And then grad school was 20 to 30.

**Okay.**

Although I would say outside of school, I still like spend a lot of time, like - I won't call it school related, but for example, for the pro bono statistics consulting project I've been working on, I spend somewhere between 10 to 15 or sometimes even closer to 20 hours per week now that it's summertime. So I've been developing skills that are relevant to my academic background; but then again, it has nothing to do with coursework. Let me frame it that way. You decide how you want to count that amount of time.  

**Should I just add 10 hours per semester for all of the per week figures?** 

Okay. Actually...yeah. I mean, it varies, so I would say 10 would be a good average estimate.  

**Sure. What about the average amount of rest hours that you had in each semester? So rest, not including sleep, but just time that you take off from work.**  

Oh, okay. Does hanging out with friends count as rest? What about volunteering?

**Uh, depends. Would you call that work or rest?**  

Uh, for me, I guess volunteering is also break. So I'd say probably in general...let me think. I kind of feel like 10 to 20 in general as an undergrad. No, maybe not that much. 10 to 15 in general as an undergrad. And nowadays I would say, well, 20 to 30. I definitely sleep less, which is not good for my health! I dunno, I've been taking art classes, so sometimes I'll draw until like 2:00 AM - don't do that! <laugh> - and just sleep for five hours and go to work and use coffee to keep myself alive. But I mean, I enjoy my life, so I won't complain.

**Okay. What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

60 to 70, somewhere along that line. 

**Could you walk me through an example of that week?**  

Oh, sure. So that was probably - so my junior year, second semester junior year...I forgot what exact classes I was taking, but before the pandemic hit, I was actually really stressed out. I was launching a student organization, so on average I spent around 10 hours dealing with different components of my student org. As for classes...so it's Monday to Friday in general. Basically between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM, I'm running between different classes. And then of course, other than class I'd be sitting in the library studying. I forgot what EECS class I took that semester, probably 281. Yes. I'd just spend so much time going to the office hours, writing the code, debugging the code, studying for the exam...whew, That was a fun time. <laugh> And then at that time I still worked as a resident advisor, so spending another 10 hour-ish just attending the regular RA meetings, attending check-ins with my supervisor / housing director, and then having regular check-ins with my residents, doing the community walks, being on duty probably twice or three times a week...Yeah. So fun times.  

**How much do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

Um...wait, when you say how I spend my time, do you mean in general? Like including both work and chill, or...?

**Both.**  

Yeah, okay. I would say back to the time when I was an undergrad, I feel like I was letting my Google calendar drive me. But now I feel like I have way more control over my time. Also, I kind of feel like nowadays, as people are working remotely, I have more flexibility regarding how to plan my schedule. As well, I actually appreciate how many classes were being recorded, because I could just watch them in my free time. Also for my current job, my supervisor is really chill and as long as I got my work done, he's fine about my working hours. To be honest, in my office there are people who start work at noon and I think work until like 8:00 PM or 9:00 PM. In my case, I would work for probably six hours during the day, have dinner, take a nap, and then I start working again at eight after the sun goes down. <laugh> When the weather is good, I just work and I think...Yeah. I like it because I hate when I'm exhausted and still have to work. So by having the freedom of picking work time and picking the exact work schedule - basically I remember the question you were asking was about like, how much control do you feel you have over your schedule? Something along that line? So I would say I really appreciate the current schedule I have.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, I would say it's probably not about enthusiasm. I've always been curious about learning. I guess it's more about time management and just, um, in general, expectations. So back in high school, I didn't need to work too hard to get a good score. The thing here is there are so many people who took really advanced AP courses or like, have a lot of exposure. Especially for more technical subjects, I feel like a lot of people have coding experience in high school and a lot of people - they're just so tech-savvy. So I kind of feel...I won't say attitude, but basically I need to work harder to catch up. Yeah. 

But I've always enjoyed learning. After coming to college, I started to think more regarding, "What's going to be the impact of this class in the long run?". So for example, by taking this class, am I going to gain skills that I can use at work and - maybe let me frame it this way, just to avoid misunderstanding. So I'm not only doing things that are useful, like I hate the idea of learning something that I would never use for the rest of my life, because I feel like this time could be used for me to do something more impactful. So for example, I would appreciate classes where I can gain skills that I can actually use at work, because then I can make an impact to the society.  

And so in terms of research projects, if it's just a research project that's for a bunch of researchers in that field, to just read each other's papers and then try to develop more research. I'm like, "Is that actually meaningful?" That's also why I left one of the psychology research labs I was in my sophomore year, just because...Like they said they could potentially help educate kids. That's what they say in a project proposal - it's never going to happen. And so I would rather volunteer at, like, maybe a teaching program or whatever. That's actually what I've done in a previous summer, I volunteered as a TA in a summer camp. So I kind of feel like compared to doing something that only looks good, I want to do something that's actually impactful. Anyway - remembered a lot! <laugh> Next question, please.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Nope. 

**Could you describe that a bit more?**  

Sure. In general, I would say I had a change of energy level after COVID hit. But not regarding attending UofM. Just going to class with new people, maybe my energy level increased a bit. Because the IB school I went to is a really small school and everyone knows everyone. And sometimes when everyone knows everyone, the community could become a little bit toxic... <laugh> Anyway, I kind of feel like I'm happier at UofM and more energetic.

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

My grades got better actually, because I worked harder! In the past...basically I kind of feel at UofM it's harder, for some of the classes at least, it's harder to get an A. I remember the first semester, I was getting 92% in a class and I ended up getting a B+. And I was like, "What the heck?" The curve was crazy! So after that, I'm just like, "Okay". Also second semester, freshman year, I took orgo 1 and didn't do too well in the class. So as soon as I realized you actually need to get a really high score to hit the A range and work harder, my academic results turned out to be better. So yeah.

**Going a different direction with the questions now: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

What type of goals are you talking about?  

**Just in general. So it can be academic, professional, or outside of school.**  

Gotcha. When I first came to college, I didn't actually have a habit of setting goals, which was bad. I would put things on my planner, but those are more like to-dos instead of long-term goals. Later I learned about the concept of smart goals. Lemme think, what else? I've been going to the LSA opportunity hub regularly, had conversations with career coaches and basically think out loud and co-create my vision with them. I feel like after that, I have a much better understanding of what would be a reasonable goal, and I stick to my goals better since then. Yeah. And now I just, um, have a habit of once in a while revisiting some of my goals and then - uh, I don't sit down regularly to write the goals, although I probably should have done that - but I say in general, at the back of my head, I think I know what I'm doing.

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Kind of, yeah.  

**Okay. Could you elaborate on that?**  

Sure. Basically I would say I've never been the top student in my classes in high school, but then I would say I've been getting pretty good grades. And I know by having that grade, I would be able to get into programs I want to get in. Maybe lemme frame it that way: in general, instead of trying to hit 99% or 100% percent, I would rather just, like, stay at around 90% to 95% and use the rest of the time on volunteer groups, student organizations, other things I'm interested in. Or just hanging out with my friends. Life is not just about studying, studying, getting a perfect grade - at least that's how I see it. 

**Did you or do you currently feel pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Um, I would say not now. I remember in my senior year and my first semester of grad school, I was really stressed out about that. But now I think like - especially in grad school, you know, everyone, like many of them are at different stages of their lives and have completely different life goals. And once I realized that, I felt like, "They do whatever that's best for them, I do whatever that's best for myself", as long as it makes a positive impact to the community and as long as I'm comfortable about where I am, I'm fine. Yeah. I mean, so I don't want to be that type of like, overachiever who holds like 20 titles on their LinkedIn page or whatever, but then I'd say I'm still pursuing a lot of things, but more on the side. So for example, I work for the pro bono project just because I think that is a really meaningful project.  

I won't share too much details, but basically it's a student support project, and student support is an initiative that really speaks to me. And as for an entrepreneurial project, I'm currently working on something like that, that is also related to student support. I just enjoy the idea, like I'm spending time on a kind of mission that I feel relevant and I feel meaningful about. So, yeah. 

**What is your relationship with failure?**

Um...in the past, I was scared of failing and stuff. But now I just kind of come to terms about it. So back at the time I worked as a resident advisor, one example they used is dropping a rubber ball versus dropping a glass ball. So if you drop a glass ball, it's a horrible, like, failure - it could be dangerous - so I try my best to avoid it. But then if it's just like small failures, well, you learn from it and you move on and that's fine. If you look at all those entrepreneurs who have launched successful companies, they failed so many times. <laugh> So it's fine.

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Uh, maybe give an example.  

**So let's say that you do well on something and someone praises you for it. Or if say, someone who looks up to you academically gives you praise.** 

I don't think that's ever happened to me. I mean, I've been getting A+ in some of my classes, but you just see that on the transcript. Nobody else, other than the instructor knows, and instructors don't go all the way out and say, "Hey, well done". It's not high school, so not applicable.

**I see. What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Uh, basically I would say I worked hard, kind of like growth mindset, you know - like I worked hard for it and then I really appreciate the outcome. I will continue working hard and then, yeah. Sometimes I do some small celebration, like just hang out with friends. Of course I won't tell them, "Hey, I got A+, let's hang out!" But then, well, if the semester ends let's maybe take a walk, something along that line. 

**How do you think others react when you succeed?** 

In general? I'm one of those people who don't like to share too much about my success story, just because I kind of feel like people who share - well, I don't want to seem arrogant, you know. So I would say 9 times out of 10, people don't know. So I don't see their reactions either, although I would assume my friends would be really happy for me. I forgot what I've accomplished back in the time when I was an undergrad, but I definitely remember my friends commending me and they were really proud of me, but I don't recall the details. Yeah. They're really wholesome people.

**Okay. Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes, definitely.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Basically, having too many things on the plate, becoming stressed out, can't operate at their max, uh, optimal condition. Yeah.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Of course. <laugh> 

**How would you define that in your own terms?**  

Oh, so basically you feel like you are at a place where you don't deserve to be. To be honest, I feel that frequently! <laugh> I'm like, "Oh my god, people around me are just overachievers, They're so impressive. Why am I here?" But yeah, basically if you have a similar feeling to that, you are experiencing imposter syndrome. 

**Do you believe you've experienced burnout?**  

Definitely.  

**Okay. Can you describe that?**  

Well, I would say in general, most of the burnouts I experienced were due to some bad, like, time management skills, some level of procrastination. Although I hate to admit that, but that's what happened. I'll just be really honest and transparent. It's like I have five papers - not that crazy, three papers due in two days, and then I'm just overwhelmed by the amount of tasks I need to accomplish. I don't experience burnout as frequently nowadays. Sometimes I'd be like, "Oh my god, so many things going on". Like last week, there were a couple of days where I had to work on data sets until 2:00 AM, but then, while that's stressful, I know I could do something to take care of my mental health later. And also I've been telling myself, "Okay, what I'm doing is really meaningful", and...so to be honest, I feel like that's really the stress I had. Once I think about the bigger picture, once I think "Okay, I'm doing something that's part of a bigger mission", something along that line. 

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yes, definitely. I still feel it once in a while.

**Could you describe some of your experiences with that?**  

Yeah...so for example, back at the time I was taking all these higher level EECS classes, I'm like, "I need to spend 20 hours on something to understand that". And I see that some people just attend the lecture and read the slides once and they're just completely fine about the concept. So I'm like, "Well, why are they so smart?" Although I know like, it's probably because they've learned that before, or they just happen to have some transferable knowledge. But then still, sometimes I can't help but feel bad about me being...not incapable, but just having to spend longer accomplishing some tasks. And I remember in my senior year, I was also kind of encountering imposter syndrome.  

Like I'm looking at all those friends who are going into fintech companies, going into like, top consulting firms, and I'm like, "Oh, wow, look at those people, look at me. Why am I here?" And even now, sometimes I feel like, "Oh my God, I got into this program, I kind of like" - basically for our entrepreneurial projects, we got in a bunch of...I won't say really competitive, but I'd say pretty competitive competitions. And then I would be like, "Are we actually in the cohort? That just doesn't feel real." And then I feel like they must have made a mistake. Although I know I should feel more comfortable about getting the opportunities, sometimes I still think in a relatively negative way. But I think nowadays with imposter syndrome, I tell myself, "Hey, that's imposter syndrome, don't think like that". Although once in a while I'll fall back into the syndrome. I'd say in general at least, I feel comfortable about coexisting with imposter syndrome. Yeah. Sorry. That's a really long answer, go ahead.

**You're good. Do you believe any of your peers have experienced burnout?**  

Definitely.  

**How prevalent do you think it is?**

Very prevalent. I think all my friends have encountered, uh, yeah. <laugh>.  

**Do you have any stories or details about your peers' experience with burnout? If appropriate.**  

Mm-hmm. I won't share the most detailed details, but I would say like, basically my friends and I, we definitely had time where basically a bunch of us, sitting together in a circle, hear about someone's burnout story and be a good listener. And then lend my shoulder when they're crying. <laugh> Yeah, that happens so many times, especially pre-pandemic. And I mean, after the pandemic, we have like weekly calls, and sometimes, some of us will just show up and then start to cry, and then everyone else listens. So kind of a help group. 

**Do you believe any of your peers have experienced imposter syndrome? How prevalent is that?**  

Um, I think almost all my best friends, yeah. They've encountered imposter syndrome. And I would say that's probably prevalent among UofM students, at least.

**And similarly, any stories or details there, if appropriate?**  

Same here. Basically in those conversations, when people burned out, they'd feel the imposter syndrome as well. 

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

I would say...to be honest, I kind of feel like now, with COVID, people - like some people have more time to reflect on their experience. So that might help with burnout or imposter syndrome situations. But I'm also aware of some other folks - like some people lose their job, some people lose their family and friends, after the pandemic. So that might increase the stress level in general and make people more likely to feel burned out.

Other questions?  

**Yep, some closing questions. So considering everything we've talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work at UofM?**  

Yes.  

**Okay. How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I've heard about the two terms, but my high school was relatively chill. I mean, I probably really felt burnt out once, when I was applying to - actually, probably twice. Once when I was applying to college, once when I was being rejected by a bunch of schools I applied to. But I would say other than that, I didn't feel that as frequently. 

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I mean, basically, I would just give really general advice regarding, like, don't compare yourself with your peers that much. To some extent, college just gives you an illusion that everyone's on the same page, but it's actually not. The sooner you come to terms with that, actually, I kind of feel like...like, it's fine, if your peers, if family...so for example, it's fine if someone can get an internship in their freshman year, it's fine. If someone got into some really prestigious companies or accelerated program or whatever, it's just fine. When other people are doing all those great stuff, you just follow your own pace, you work hard, and you'll be fine. I know that probably sounds cheesy. And probably if I give that advice to my 18-year-old self, I'd be like, "Wow, really?" But looking back from now, literally that's how I feel.

**Is there anything else you'd like to say?**  

No, thank you.  

**And thank you. We'll be wrapping up there then.**
