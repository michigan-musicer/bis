**Alright. As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

So I attended high school in my home country. I did like all levels of, um, I think they're called IGCSEs now. So I did IGCSEs in grades 9 and 10, and then I did the IB diploma program for grade 11 and 12. Of course I took SATs, SAT I and SAT II, things like that. So yeah, I think that's pretty much it.

**One follow up question: what is IGCSE?** *[Answer: International General Certificate of Secondary Education.]*  

Yeah, so it's a British standardized exam. Uh, it's like a grade 10 level exam. That would be a popular examination that people in my country would take for their grade 10 mark. Like that would kind of mark that they finished grade 10, and also a lot of schools and universities in the UK require IGCSE. uh, to do. And it's like an exam that comes before A-levels. Do you know A-levels?  

**Is that another British exam?**  

Yeah, that's also British exams. So A-levels would be kind of like standardized curriculum exams that all the UK universities ask for.  

**Okay. Approximately how many people did you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Uh, peers in like, people I know? Or actual friends?  

**Whatever definition makes more sense to you. I think most people have been reporting sort of...people in your major, but not necessarily people that you speak to every day.**  

Um, so peers, probably around...forty? Something like that. Yeah.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your major?**  

Three and a half years.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

What made me decide on my major? So I knew that I wanted to do computer science since I started. And what ultimately made me decide was that, uh, I think I enjoyed the classes, and I felt like I was doing more. I was taking engineering 101 and then moved on towards EECS 280, things like that. And I felt like I was doing well. And it was appealing to me. I wanted to just kinda build things and develop things, and initially I was thinking I might wanna do fun stuff, like hacking and building games and things like that.

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Memorable story regarding academics? Sorry, probably need to think a little bit...I have a couple, but one that I would say that was memorable is completing EECS 482 projects with my project partner / roommate at the time. It was very memorable mainly because it was extremely stressful. I haven't really had that much anxiety in a course or a class that I remember. For later projects, like project three and four, we were like, trying to get tests passing by submitting it online to autograder. And each time we'd submit to autograder, it would not really, you know, we wouldn't see the improvements in the tests that we pass, for example. And we only got a limited number of submissions. So that added a lot of stress, especially late at night, when we were really hoping that, "Okay, finally, we're gonna get this done". We wanna be able to enjoy completing the project. But that never comes. <laugh> Yeah, so that kind of thing, in that way, was very memorable. But also very rewarding at the end.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

Hmm. Average semester. So are we counting class time?  

**Sure, whatever you would consider work.**  

Okay. Um, average hours per week, right? So if I have to count efficient times - you know, of course, that a lot of work might not be efficient sometimes - but yeah, I'll just count usually how much time I would sit down and spend, even though it might not be efficient. I guess it would probably be like 45 hours. 40, 45 hours.

**And then for an average semester, what is the average number of rest hours you got per week?**  

Rest hours?  

**Yeah. So not sleep, but hours that you are resting while you're awake.**  

Um, let me think. Does going to the gym count? Or doing sports?  

**Mm-hmm, whatever you would consider relaxation. So if you find that relaxing, then go ahead and include that.**  

Oh yeah. It's kinda a leisure activity. So I would say, um, I would say 28 hours or 30 hours. I'm not sure whether my answers are really...how do you say it? Atypical, but yeah. That's how I'm thinking, I guess.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

I guess probably 50 plus hours.  

**Okay. And then for that semester, what was the average number of rest hours you got per week?**  

Uh - I'm just guessing - probably 22 hours, something like that.  

**What is the most hours you've worked in a single week?**

Possibly 56 hours.  

**Can you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Yeah. The one I'm thinking of is the EECS 482 semester. I would definitely work the weekends, so I was just counting around eight hours a day. Including the weekends, it's like 56 hours, something along those lines.  

Those eight hours would probably include watching lectures and doing assignments and stuff like that.  

**How much control did you feel you had over how you spent your time?**  

Honestly there wasn't too much control. I was usually motivated with the fact that like, deadlines are coming over, there are projects to be done...yeah. There's always something that I'm walking towards, like a deadline, quizzes, or projects. So I felt there was not too much control. I just have, like, I have to complete it; there's no other choice.   

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

That's interesting, change in enthusiasm...I would say pretty much the same. I might think that freshman year, I was more motivated, because that's the first year. But it gets more challenging, and then it gets more interesting, the things that I'm learning. So overall, I loved learning new things, and I loved the sense of achievement from completing new courses and understanding new concepts. So if anything, I feel like it probably just increased.

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Overall energy level I think was about the same, probably more. I felt like...university toughens us up. Yeah. University is a time when I felt like I'm stretching my limits in terms of how much work I'm doing. In that way, it trains us to work harder. So generally my energy level probably increased.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah. My freshman year I performed the best; I was close to 4.0. Starting from the second year, I was averaging B+ in my courses. B+, A-, between that. So like 3.6, something like that. And then, I mainly think because of job search and the stress that job search adds to it, a lot of the times I felt like I was not able to spend the full time just working on things. There's always time I have to spend for career stuff, because it's entirely necessary for me as an international student to get work experience so that I don't have to go back, you know?

So I guess after freshman year it kinda decreased. And it kinda stayed at the same level.  

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Goals for myself? Usually goals I set for myself are not entirely realistic. For example going to the gym every day, doing the same routine, something like that - I was not able to accomplish it. So not really? I guess a lot of goals I might not really accomplish, but it kind of makes me improve,  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yes. At my school, my class is really small, so I was basically the best student in my class.  

**Could you elaborate on that?**  

Yeah. So in my IB diploma program, my class was very small. We only had eight students, for example, and not all of them were particularly serious about academics. I was pretty serious about it, and since I was in middle school, I've been like, top student in the class. It's also because my school is not that big, so there are not too many other extremely strong students, at least in my grade. I'm just judging based on the scores - the exam scores and test scores. For my IP diploma program, I got basically the highest score in the class, for example.  

**Okay. Did you ever feel pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

<laugh> Superhuman? Yeah, I guess because, like, there are really, really strong students, you know? The bar is really high, like for exams, especially after I took the elective courses, I realized how hard it is to achieve a really strong score. But I also wanted to achieve strong skills. So I felt it was in a sense, superhuman, just to be the best at everything.

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

Um, yeah, one thing I know for sure is that failure is something that I'm very scared of. That probably keeps me from trying some daring things, for example. So I sometimes take safe choices and stuff. But yeah, I have kind of learned to, um, I guess appreciate what I have. I haven't felt like - I haven't had a big, big failure during my studies. So I guess that's partially because I really am scared of failure.

**Hm. How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

<laugh> I would, uh, appreciate it, but I don't feel like too much to praise. Because I know that I can always be better, I can always improve. 

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Mmm, happiness. Happiness and a sense of achievement. Also maybe a confidence boost.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

Oh, that's a very general question. Like others as in my friends?  

**Let's say whoever you count as your peers. How about that?**  

Okay. I mean, I think overall, my peers would be happy for me if I succeed in something.

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah. It's like you lose motivation because of working too hard. Is that correct? 

**<shrugging motion on camera>** 

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes. Yeah. Imposter syndrome. It's like you feel like you shouldn't be here, and you're an imposter because everyone around you is very good.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

I would say I've had small burnouts. Particularly after a tough period of working. I realized that after I exert a lot of energy and time into doing something, then I sometimes have the burnout of like, "I don't want to do anything" for that time, for example. So yeah, in that sense I've had a few of them. Particularly during the 482 semester. Yeah.  

But I haven't had burnout that's really, like, bad for me. That would make me abandon everything. Yeah, I don't, I don't think I've had that kind of "abandonment" burnout.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah. At Michigan, I have probably experienced it. Um, it's not because of achievements or anything, it's mainly, I guess, social stuff. It's not academic.

**Do you care to elaborate?**  

Yeah. So Something like, um, maybe something like, I'm not - how do you say, like...likable? Or something like that? Like I'm...different, something like that. I've kind of had that a bit, especially my start of the university and before my third year. I would probably have that a little bit in my high school as well. Like I don't fit in, something like that. But I kind of stopped having that after my third year.  

I don't think that's like, imposter syndrome, but...imposter syndrome is usually based on achievements and stuff, right? So I guess if that's the case, then no.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout was among your peers?**  

Hmm. I'm just trying to think if I had any peers who had a bad burnout. I don't think any of them particularly had a bad one...yeah. Maybe I'm not aware of it.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome was among your peers?**  

Um, I, I'm not aware of anyone opening up to me about it. Um, yeah, in my, my friends.  

**Okay. How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

So I would say, um, I might not have survived the last semesters - as in maintaining grades that I want - if they didn't have the flexible grading, and allowing us to just mark pass/fail and then not having it affect our GPA.    

That was very helpful, and I think that really helped in maintaining, like, my wellbeing to the extent that I didn't have a burnout. Yeah.  

**Alright, we're close to wrapping up. Considering everything that we talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yeah, I enjoyed the academic work. I really did enjoy it. Yeah.

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Um, I would say I was not...I kind of knew the term imposter syndrome already, but probably not burnout.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Um, I would say...just focus on - don't spread yourself too thin. Just focus on things that are in your control. Don't focus on things that are like, out of your control. And uh, each of us have different, very unique skills that we can always improve upon. And we don't have to compare ourselves to others. That would probably be the main advice that I would give. Like don't compare yourselves to others, I guess.    

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

So I have a question about this interview. Is this interview - it's mainly on imposter syndrome and burnout and how students are feeling about it, right?  

**Mm-hmm.**

Okay, what would the results be used for? Why would the survey be useful?  

**I sent you an email about it, but I can summarize it real quick here as well. This would be part of a website where you can view all the interviews. There would be some basic aggregation of results for qualitative analysis and some quantitative, although not too much because I don't have too many people in the series.**  

**The main benefit that I'm hoping for is that this gives students a lot of stories to hopefully relate to if they feel like they're experiencing imposter syndrome or burnout. Which I hope would help people who are going through those things.**  

Got it, got it. Yeah, there might be some things that I might have forgotten about regarding what I actually felt, because right now I’m working in kind of a stress-free spot. So this might affect a bit of my answers - that's just one caveat that I just wanna make. Yeah. And I'm just remembering a bit more...I did have a friend who had a burnout. But after a while, he was able to improve and take the time, I guess - I think he did an extra year. I think another thing I just wanna add is like, it's all temporary. After we get out into a good spot, then um, yeah. Things will improve, I guess.  

**Thank you for this interview, I'll stop the recording here.**
