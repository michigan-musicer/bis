**Tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Uh...I went to public school, minus kindergarten? If that counts? It's pretty normal. Not much special, I guess. I mean, that's the only way I would describe it without more questions.

I mean, I did okay, in school. I wasn't amazing, but you know, I did okay.

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I mean, it's a big school, so I don't talk to too many people. Peers...I mean, taken literally, I would just think of people in my classes, which is a lot of people. But in terms of people that I actually interact with, I mean, it's kind of hard to think of a number. But it's very small. I don't interact with too many people here. Less than 50 for sure.

**Okay. How many years have you been in your major?**  

I declared my freshman year, so two and a half. But I always knew I was gonna major in CS, so for all intents and purposes, I was always a CS major.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

There's a cleaner story, and then there's I think the more realistic one. Uh, I don't know. Junior year of high school, I knew that I had to apply for college in a year. I didn't know what I would study...I mean, I kind of always vaguely knew that I wanted to study something STEM-related of course, 'cause I always wanted to be a professor. And math, physics, those kind of things were always something that...it's not like I really stuck out in them, but I did enjoy doing those things in school. I didn't spend all my free time doing it or anything, but if I had to choose, I'd choose something in that area. 

Then there's I think the more realistic one. Uh, I don't know. Junior year of high school, I knew that I had to apply for college in a year.

And math, physics, those kind of things were always something that...it's not like I really stuck out in them, but I did enjoy doing those things in school. I didn't spend all my free time doing it or anything, but if I had to choose, I'd choose something in that area.  

I guess maybe even a little bit earlier, I was a little bit interested in, um - like I was first interested in just C programming? <laugh> I didn't do it, I didn't spend a lot of time; but, you know, I thought it was fun. And you know, I knew applications were coming up, I'd have to apply in a year, and I was thinking about it a lot. And I realized I actually do wanna study computers. Like it's something that I wish I knew better, 'cause they're just sort of a block box and I'd started using - I don't know this is related - I had started using Linux a couple times through high school. I'd used it once for a while and then dropped it after about a year, my sophomore year or something.  

But anyways, the point being that even before that, I kind of wanted to know more about how computers worked, 'cause they were insanely complicated. So I think - you know, there's sort of this subliminal messaging where, you know, everyone's always saying, "You study CS, you get paid well". That wasn't exactly...you know, I knew I was going, I was trying to go into academia, I think. So that wasn't a huge decision factor, but definitely when everyone around you says it all the time, you feel like it's a pretty safe choice. 

So yeah, I basically decided I'd for sure study CS maybe towards the end of my junior year, and it's been pretty dead set ever since then. Maybe even before that. Of course, my subfield interests have changed, but I've always been interested in computers basically. I'd like to say for a while that I'm interested, and I'm surprised not more people are interested in computers our age because we use them all the time. We're, you know, the first generation to grow up with them when they're actually good.  

So, uh, I think that answers the question.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

That's a fun question. Um, memorable? I kind of have short term memory. Probably most memorable would be this one time when a professor, uh, was just being very sincere and talking about him dealing with some of his personal problems as a tenure track faculty in his early days. That was something I didn't expect to hear that day, but it was nice to hear people's experiences, and it was memorable for sure. I couldn't tell you why, but that was something that, you know - if you were to frame the question as "What did you like about going to Michigan?" for example, I won't exactly say that was one of the reasons I liked being here, but in some sense...maybe yeah. Like I'm glad I got to hear that.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**

<laugh> I couldn't pin down anything close to something accurate, because you just have so many weeks where you don't do anything and so many weeks where you're barely sleeping enough. That's how I work, I dunno if other people always do that. But yeah, it's really hard to say. Even when I think I'm working a lot - I've been giving a diary this year, actually, and I'll look at it and sometimes I'm like "Wow, I actually worked way more than I realized I worked". And then sometimes I'm like, "Wow, there's so much less than I thought I did". So it's really, really hard to say. I had a professor say one time, in a different context, that your full-time job is to be a student. It's to study. So I mean, yeah, it's a full-time job. Full-time meaning different things to different people I guess, but it's full time.  

**Are you able to provide any numerical range, even if like, the range is a hundred hours?**  

Uh, honestly I don't think I've ever done a hundred hours. For some reason I can't work that hard.  

**So the range is less than a hundred hours!**  

I mean, if you're talking about number of work hours, like if you're at a job...honestly I probably don't do more than 40 on an average. Even now, my "job" right now is to read a bunch of stuff, basically. And it's, you know, full time. I'm still actually not really putting in more than 40 hours of actual work, and it's because I'm spending a bunch of time just thinking about other stuff. So do I spend 40 hours a week or whatever on my actual schoolwork? Not really. But there's always a bunch of other stuff I'm kind of always doing. So hard to say, but I would say around 40 or maybe less, even.  

**Okay. What is the average number of waking rest hours you get in an average week in an average semester?**  

I mean, I'm one of those very temperamental workers. I take a break whenever I feel like I need to take a break, and I'll work as long as I really feel like I can keep working. So I don't think an average number of hours of rest per day would be very helpful; but that said, if I ballpark how much I work at 40 hours a week, then I'm not working more than eight hours a day usually.  

**Should I assume the rest of that day is rest, or...?**  

I mean, I wouldn't call it rest, but they're not working. <laugh> I dunno. In the last couple days, 'cause that's the only thing I can be more concrete about, I'd maybe be at the office for 10 hours or so, but I don't really spend all of them working on the actual work. Then I come home. So during the middle of the day, I would say I maybe spend two hours, you know, not doing actual work. So I don't know, I'll say two hours in the middle of the day?  

**Okay. What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whatever that was?**  

I mean, I'm sure there's been a week where I basically either slept or worked and wasn't on my phone or anything. At least, not more than an hour a day summed up. So I mean, you sleep for eight hours...maybe 14 hours a day for six days or something, roughly? I've probably done that at least once, but then I usually just never work the week after because I just burn out. <laugh> Like I probably did that during 21 in the spring, because that was the only thing I was doing at the time.  

**So whatever 14 times 6 is?**  

Yeah, like 84 I'd say?  

**Okay. But that's not your average per week in that semester.**  

Oh, average per week in a semester. My bad. The average...I guess that probably was my busiest semester, just 'cause it was a spring term. I wouldn't say 80 per week, but definitely more than 40 per week. So I don't know. You can probably say 60.  

**Okay.**  

But yeah, not like a normal semester in fall or winter.  

**And then do you happen to have a guess on the number of rest hours during that semester? Per week?**  

I mean, I think a pretty good approximation of that spring term was I would wake up and work, and then I would eat dinner and work, and then I'd go to bed. I think that's pretty close. Anything else that wasn't sleeping, which was nine hours maybe...maybe three hours in total a day, including dinner and everything.   

I dunno. These numbers are random. It varies so much.  

**Then for the most number of hours you worked in a single week, would that be the 84 you mentioned earlier?**  

That's pretty close.

**Then can you walk through an example of that week?**

Oh, technically I did that. The thing about 281 was it was a lot of...maybe busywork is a bit derisive, but they were kind of just pure coding, you know? And so really every day I would wake up, maybe if there was lecture that day, watch lecture, and if not I'd just wake up later and then just code the entire day, just straight up. I mean, it's weird. I can't work that hard when it comes to studying, but when it comes to programming, I can usually go at it for as long as I want. It's kinda weird. But I would really just try to go the entire day, minus dinner and lunch. That's really what my week looked like. I mean, I really didn't do anything else.  

**Okay. How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

This is something I was thinking about recently...I'm trying to think of a shorter way to say this. In general, in the past I struggled with it a lot. Starting in middle school, even, I just would go home - and is way farther back than you were thinking - but I'd go home after school, I'd just be tired 'cause you know, it's eight hours of school or whatever. It's a long day. Then I would just be on my phone for probably...I would have to say at least two hours a day on average. I mean, it was bad, and I kind of knew it was bad. But I didn't really care 'cause it was middle school, I didn't have anything else to do. In high school it was kind of the same, but it got worse when I actually got more busy and I started to realize it was, you know, not great. <laugh> 

But I still wasn't a very good student, so who cares? And when you don't have an eight hour schedule block, it's much...I don't tend to be as tired I guess, but still, I would realize that I would spend significant portions of the day where maybe I was studying, and then at some point if I couldn't keep studying anymore, so I'd hop on YouTube. And there's two hours out the window, like three hours goes out the window. I don't know when I started trying to crack down on it, but this year, at least, I realized that was a huge problem.   

It's a little hard to say because I haven't really done the retrospective analysis, but it's gotten better recently. I feel like I know what to do in order for it to not happen. Honestly - so this is going on a tangent, but that's one of the reasons I started playing go. I wanted to, you know, if I ever am just at a point where I can't work, I'm tired, whatever, and I just wanted do something for a break instead of jumping on YouTube or something, I could just play go. At the very least it's something you'll get better at over time, whereas I mean, you can just watch YouTube your whole life, but it's just entertainment. So I feel like I've definitely wrestled more control over it in the last school year...but it still happens. I mean even the last couple days, I would burn a couple hours more on YouTube over some days than I planned to. But it's gotten better.  

So to answer your question: do I feel like I have control? I mean now, mostly. Before, honestly, not really. I realize that when I'm tired, everything goes out the window basically. So yeah, I know what to do when I'm tired, essentially. Like I have to plan out what I'm gonna do when I get tired, so that when I get tired, I don't just start doing random stuff.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, I think I've been more enthused. I didn't know what academic work really was before college.  

**Okay. Could you elaborate then on what academic work means to you in this case?**  

Well, work people in academia would do. I mean, that can include college students, I suppose, and in that sense I'm not enthused to do assignments. But I found topics that I'm really interested in. And before college, I mean, there was stuff I was interested in, but not enough to like, actually think about them. But at college I found some subfields that I found really interesting, and from there, I really wanted to go all out at it. So doing technical work in those areas is interesting to me, yeah. That didn't happen until I came to Michigan, 'cause I didn't know about them before.      

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, I think so. I mean, I was always the kid that would fall asleep every day, 'cause I...I don't know what it was. I just never slept very well and would always fall asleep in class 'cause you know, eight hours of school was terrible because you'd just be tired the entire day and after.  

But I mean, the college schedules are definitely nicer! You have more choice of when you have class, when you do things, and you have less class in general and the topics - maybe not the first year, but after that they get more interesting, and there's things you care about. Like specific things you care about. And I definitely have energy to go after them now, whereas before college - especially late high school, every single day I was tired and never wanted to do anything really. So yeah. I think the academic interest and slowly getting to know how to deal with myself better? You know, the time stuff from before. Um, I definitely have more energy now than before.  

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, in the large picture? No, Like I was always one of those students that was good, but wasn't amazing. But it was good. And then, you know, I came to Michigan and I think I was slowly becoming a much better student, personally. But relative to other people, I mean, there are some just insane people in Michigan. So on a relative scale, I don't think I've really changed. It's still just like, a good, but definitely not amazing academic standing or status or whatever. I guess the whole scale was kind of shifted, so you know, I'm definitely way stronger than I was in high school, middle school, that kind of thing. But relative to everyone at Michigan, I'm still similar to where I was relative to my high school peers.

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

I don't know if I have goals, besides trying to wake up. <laugh> And I really mean that! So when I said I was temperamental, I mean really - if I feel like I wanted to go and look at something. I'll just spend all my time looking at it. It's not a goal; it's just what I feel like doing in that period of time.    

I take classes and so usually there's some amount of overhead of assignments and stuff you have to do, but there's not like a "goal" really. I mean, I prefer not to do poorly in them 'cause I need to like, go to grad school. That's considered a goal, but that's like...you know, I wanna be a professor, and that's one of the things we need to do. Um, yeah, I don't know if I have goals like other people. My only goal is to like, not fail the track of trying to be a professor. <laugh>  

That's kinda a lie. I mean, my other goal is figure out how to have more control over my time, basically. That's I guess been very slow, but overall semi-successful, I guess.  

**Okay.**  

**I think you already touched on this a bit, but in your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

I mean, it depends on who you're asking, right? Definitely wasn't exceptionally strong in a sense of - I mean, just for reference, there's this Michigan math contest called...MMPC? I would always do poorly on MMPC for example, or whatever the other qualifying exam was for the, like, olympiad or whatever. Point is, in school I would be okay and pretty good, I guess, but I was never exceptional in any sort of sense. Never even did reasonably at one of these state-level competitions or anything.

I mean it depends what you're asking. Some people would say that's like, good enough; but I would say it's like, good, but not outstanding in any sort of way.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Um, no. I mean, pressure from who? 'cause I'm just thinking, no one's really pressuring me except myself. I mean, uh, yeah. I don't know where the pressure would come from, so no, I do not feel that way.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

I fail a lot? I dunno, maybe you can call it a blessing? You know, because I was never a very strong student or anything, I guess I've always been realistic. Like I'm not that strong of a student, I fail a lot. Uh, yeah. I mean, it's not fun when you fail at something, but it's not shocking to me or anything, and it doesn't discourage me in a sense. Because I know I'm just - I'd be more surprised if I did well at things, honestly. So yeah. <laugh>  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Uh, I guess any sort of praise is nice, even if it's sort of unfounded? I mean first of all, who's even giving you praise? Is it maybe your parents or something?

I mean your friends aren't like, "Wow, you...get such good grades?" You know, no one will be praising you. As far as me - I say "you" in the figurative sense, I guess - someone praises you in general, it's not like a bad feeling, but you're sort of like "Sure, but I know there's still a bunch of stuff I need to work on. But sure."  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Um...move on the next thing. <laugh>  

**Okay. Any elaboration on that?**  

Well, it's a little hard to answer, because succeed in what? It really depends, right? Like succeeding by passing a class, you know, you're not that happy. I mean, of course you're happy on a relative scale; if you failed the class, you'll be pretty upset. But I'm not like throwing a party for myself when I pass a class or I succeed in...I don't know. I don't really count my wins. Uh, I don't have that many?

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I mean, usually they don't really notice. Everyone's kind of got their own thing going on, so if I finally, you know, do well on something that I've been working really hard on, I don't think other people really notice. <laugh> It doesn't really affect them.  

**Alright, have you heard the term burnout before?**  

The term what? Burnout? Oh yeah yeah yeah.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Uh, when you work really hard for a long time and then get tired and don't wanna do any more work for a while.  

**Okay. Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?** 

Yes.

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

I'm actually not really sure. For something that people talk about all the time...I mean, I could regurgitate a definition I think I remember, which is something like, "You think you don't deserve..." Actually, I don't even know. I actually don't really get it. I never really got it because I think I always felt like I was usually pretty...how do you say it? In general I knew what I was good at and what I wasn't good at and how relative to other people it was, and so - that's kind of a weird way of putting it, but yeah, I never really got, like, I guess I don't get the definition. I mean, the definition I think made no sense to me because...sorry. Yeah, I guess I just never really got what it really was.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Um, in the short term? Yeah, for sure. I'd say, work for a week straight and then be like, "Nope, I'm taking a break". And you know, you feel it on a more micro scale on a daily basis. You work for a long time, you're kind of like, "Okay, I'm done for a while". In the longer term, I mean, not substantially, Because if it did, it'd be very problematic.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Well, I don't really get the definition.  

**I guess what I can do is I can read you a definition and ask if that relates to you?**  

Okay.  

**All right. Let me pull this up....Uh, so this definition I got from a survey paper back when I was coming up with these questions. It describes imposter syndrome as "a phenomenon that describes high achieving individuals who, despite their objective successes, fail to internalize their accomplishments and have persistent self-doubt and fear of being exposed as a fraud or imposter".**  

Okay. No. For a couple reasons: I mean, the premise, uh, is not fulfilled, because I'm not a high achiever. So that already doesn't apply. And I definitely have never felt like I was afraid of being exposed as a fraud. I'm a slow learner, but I try to feel like everything I learn is well-grounded in a sense, so I don't think I'd ever be afraid of someone asking me something and I'm just like having to pass it off - like I know about it, but I don't actually know it at all. I mean, I do that in casual conversations sometimes, but not in any sort of severe sense.  

**I will say before moving on that that definition I used is not the one definition of imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome is not something that can be clinically diagnosed as of yet, so it's not defined within, you know, the handbooks that all the physicians have to diagnose things. So that's just like one definition. Maybe there's another definition that might be more relevant.**  

Okay. I mean the fraud part I've heard before, and yeah, that part never felt applicable.    

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I mean, 'cause as I said earlier, I think everyone kind of just has their own things going on, and...maybe that's just because I don't really talk to people, but I don't feel like I would even know about it if people did have burnout. So I'm not aware of it being prevalent, just because even if it was, I wouldn't hear about it, I feel like. I mean I had some friends who dropped out - I don't know if they *dropped out* dropped out - because they didn't wanna stay in school for whatever reasons. But at the same time they were also people that didn't really study that hard anyways, so I don't know if you call it burnout versus just being in the wrong environment.  

**Okay. I would expect a similar answer here, but how prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

So yeah, I can't say. But people talk about it, so it's prevalent enough.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

It hasn't, or it's made it better. <laugh> I dunno. I think there's too many things that all kind of got thrown into the same time period, so it's a little hard to say how COVID specifically was a factor. I would say not affected, definitely not negatively.  

**Close to wrapping up, just a few more questions. Considering everything that we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yeah, I do. I mean, I don't enjoy every single one of my classes the same amount, but in general, yeah.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Uh, not? And I still really am not.  

**Okay. If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Uh, I wouldn't, I mean, I don't think in that context I would tell my past self anything. 

Although I will say I, I kind of lied-ish. It's not that I didn't think about burnout before COVID; I definitely had some rough experiences. They're a little hard to describe, but it was effectively...I wouldn't call it burnout, but you know, I knew how hard academics could be, like emotionally. <laugh> The short of it is I was the only one that I knew in this class I was taking that I was having a really hard time with. I was taking linear algebra and I didn't know anyone in the class, and you know, no one from my school at the time was taking it - at least as I was aware of! And I was a terrible student, so, you know, every Thursday I had to go to East hall and try to work on the homework on my own and didn't really study. So I didn't really get what was going on. Banging my head against the homework until 4:00 AM every day...it was due on Friday, so I'd go and hand it in.  

This is back when you had to hand in assignments on paper, you know. So I'd go hand it in by their office in the middle of the night. And after that went on for a while...it was definitely very hard. I wouldn't call it burnout, but I knew like...that wasn't fun, let's just say, to go through that experience. And I knew I was the causative factor in a lot of it and such, so I never felt burnout 'cause I knew there were things that could make it not happen. I did enjoy the class overall, so I wouldn't really call it burnout in the traditional sense. But I was aware of that sort of effect, that if you just throw yourself against the wall, it can feel that way.  

**Is there anything else you like to say?** 

Uh...what is this for?  

**Should be in the email I sent you, but it's essentially collecting stories from students about these two subjects, 'cause I think that might be helpful for some people.**  

Okay. Yeah.

**<laugh> Okay. I just find it funny that you were interviewing for something that you weren't aware of. [Editor's note: this is not really that funny, and I'm glad in retrospect that the interviewee did actually read it.**]  

Well, no, I mean, I read that part, but I was curious if there was some additional text that was not included in the email.  

**World domination? No, I mean that's basically it. Well, thank you for interviewing. I will stop recording here.**  

Sure.
