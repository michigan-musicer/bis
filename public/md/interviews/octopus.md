**Alright - as a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Mm-hmm. So I grew up in Massachusetts. Most of elementary school, I was in this one town, and I guess since middle school I was in another town. In terms of stuff about my schools...high school was like a typical high school. I guess demographics-wise there was a decent amount of diversity, at least compared to neighboring towns. I don't know if that's in any way useful, but, um...yeah, like most students took AP credits. Most students took a few AP classes or credits. I think I took four classes, and then I took an additional like four tests for classes I didn't take. So that was my background there. Um, yeah, went all the way up to calculus for math, science I had the standards...Is there anything in particular you wanna know about school? I'm not totally sure what's relevant or what isn't?  

**Just general stuff, so I think what you said is fine.**  

Yeah. I wouldn't say - so I think it may have been competitive, like a little bit competitive, but personally I don't think it was that big a deal for me, at least. Competing against other students wasn't really a thing, it was more just, you know, if they have a hard class. Interestingly, I actually think the humanities classes in my high school were way harder than any humanities classes I took at UofM. Definitely. So at least in one sense, I think  - math obviously was the reverse, way harder in Michigan! <laugh> But yeah, I'd say that academics-wise, it may have been comparable, or at least for upper-level classes that I was taking. Um, what else is useful? Most students took AP I think the average...I can maybe double check stats. I think I would expect the average student to have taken at least a couple AP.   

Nah, maybe...I don't know a lot. Most students that I interacted with were taking AP, but maybe that's not a representative sample. But it wasn't like no one took AP, it wasn't like that. A lot of people took AP classes. I don't remember much about burnout in high school; I was never super stressed out. Uh, okay, that's not totally true. I got stressed out 'cause of college apps, but I think in terms of classes, nothing was ridiculously stressful.   

At least in retrospect comparing it to Michigan. <laugh> So I can talk more about any of that if you want, but yeah, that's at a high level some of the stuff.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I mean...I'm not so sure what I think about that question actually. Like when I think of here, I just think about the class. Oh, uh, you there?  

**Hello? Yes?**  

Okay, I'm looking my side monitor, 'cause my main monitor just died. <laugh> 

Um, so yeah. I'd probably say most of my classmates, or anyone who's taking an EECS class or CS class - I would generally consider them my peer. I don't know if...I don't know if I mentally separate people into peers versus not peers. I guess anyone in my general age group or who's doing similar stuff, so I guess anyone who's in engineering and a similar year. Was there something more specific you meant by peer? I'm not totally sure if that's what you meant.  

**I was curious on your definition.**  

Yeah. When I think of peer, I just think of anyone who maybe, like, have one to two years separation. Now both monitors have died. The hell? Okay. Wait. No. <laugh> Okay, like if I was a freshman, probably not seniors, I probably wouldn't think of them like peers. But people who are a similar age and - not even studying similar stuff, they can study whatever. I guess I think peers as more just age-wise or something.

**Do you have an approximate number on that?**  

Oh, uh, how many students are in Michigan? <laugh> Maybe 10K? 20K? I don't know how to answer this question, 'cause like I never think about, "Oh, this person's my peer" versus not my peer. I just think, "Oh, I talked to this person" or, "Oh, I worked on a project with this person". So in that sense at least, it would probably just be 10, 20K students. I dunno if any of this made sense, I'm just nodding my head and pretending like I know what I'm saying.  

**Okay. <laugh> I'd really be curious about an approximate number of people you talk to and people you have worked on projects with.**  

Oh, so like, I guess maybe closer acquaintances and stuff like that?

**Sure, whatever you would call them.**  

Oh yeah, okay. I guess in terms of closer acquaintance, like people I interact with and people who I - dude, why is Zoom so bad for my computer? I literally don't understand. Okay, if it dies at any point, just lemme know. Um, yeah, in terms of people who I interact with on a regular enough basis - either I am familiar enough to interact with or work on a project or reach out for like random request or anything like that - I would probably say the number's closer to...I'd say between 60 to 80 people. People who I've interacted with enough so it wouldn't feel weird for me to hit them up out the blue or just like text or message or something like that.

**How many years were you in your major?**  

Um, four years, six semesters.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

It was senior year. I took AP computer science, and my entire friend group was in it, and it was such a meme class. It was so fun. Like we'd do our work in half the time, the rest of the time we'd be playing some computer games. <laugh> One of my friends was like, "Yo guys, apparently software engineers make a lot of money, so I'll just keep doing this". So I'm like, okay.  

I think over time - like I enjoyed the subjects that we learned in CS, so it wasn't anything like, "I hate this and I wanna switch out". It was fine enough, you know, in terms of job prospects and in terms of interest that it was good enough for me not to switch out. In retrospect, I totally could imagine myself having done something else, like econ or math or something. But, um, yeah. One friend, and then we were just like, a lot of us decided to do it. It wasn't a good decision, but after taking some time and exploring, it was kind of like, it's, eeeeeehhhh, it's okay!  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

There were a lot of projects that I really enjoyed. Some random projects, like in engineering 100, or just research - not research per se, but more just reading the literature and then summarizing some paper, those kind of projects that we had in a few classes. I think for my cryptography class, there was one on computation complexity. Those were a lot of fun, because it was interesting to explore the cutting edge and then tinker around with ideas or build something new. So for cryptography, my group dove into a research paper on a specific cryptocurrency protocol algorithm. I don't remember it much now, but it was interesting to read about the algorithm design.  

And then yeah, for computational complexity. We did the computational complexity of video games, which is kind of hilarious! Like what is the computational complexity of beating Mario or something like that. And that was interesting too. Those were memorable 'cause they were interesting and fun. There were other memorable experiences that just sucked, but they were memorable 'cause...they sucked. I just remember my third semester and then my seventh semester as being just like, "Fuck." <laugh> This is a very memorable semester cause I was taking hard classes that took a lot of time, and then also doing a serious amount of job searching along with it. And also doing all the other extracurricular stuff. So those were memorable for the late nights! Or just waking up and not - you know, it's funny.  

The best way for me to describe the change that this had - if someone asked me...I think my third semester was when I took EECS 281, EECS 370, EECS 376, and then some other class. It was the first semester where - so an all-nighter used to be this kind of nuke that you'd use to wipe away all your homework in one shot, and you'd be good to go for the next couple days. The all-nighter turned from a nuke to more like a, just like a tactical strike that you just have to use whenever you could. And you take away some work. It'll never take away all the work, but you'll at least get some respite.  

So that's kind of how that semester went. My senior year first semester wasn't like that in terms of all-nighters, it was more just like very difficult, difficult classes that I had to spend a lot of time to understand. But yeah, those were memorable for the difficulty, for the amount of time I spent, and for the fact that after that semester it was just so nice to take a break. So yeah. I can talk more those if you want.  

**I think that's good for now.**   

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

So let's see, average I work per week...so in an average semester...you know what, I might be able to double check this. I have stats if you want. If it takes more than two minutes, I'll just make an estimate; but let's just see if I have the data.

Yeah, I've been tracking the time I spent the past year, it's kind fun. You get to see some weird shit, like "Oh, I spent 80 hours watching a TV show". So this is purely for classwork, right? Not for recruiting and stuff? 

**Uh, whatever you would consider work. So include basically anything you wouldn't call relaxation.**  

Okay. Hmm...this was an exceptional semester. I would probably put it like 25% less, probably. So maybe like 95 hours per month.

Maybe I'd say 22 to 25 hours a week of classes, or of school-related work. Maybe add an extra 7 to 10 hours, or maybe like six to eight hours, for recruiting. And then for club stuff, maybe add another four to five hours? Uh, no no no. Add like another 7 to 8 hours there. So what's...but what is that, like 30? Yeah, around 37 to 41 or something like that.  

Maybe you can have more for research, but honestly I'll just add five in total. So maybe 42 to 48 per week or something like that. It seems lighter than it should be, but I dunno, might be discounting some stuff.  

**For an average week in an average semester, how many hours of waking rest did you get?**  

Waking rest?  

**I'm looking for rest that you have while you're awake.**  

Oh, uh, okay. Let's see. On average, I would expect maybe 25 hours a week. Maybe around two to four hours a day on a semester that wasn't terrible, plus a little bit extra time with the weekend. That might be an overestimate, but it's tough to say because either my semesters were super easy or they were super hard. The average semester's a bit interesting. So yeah, on a bad semester it would be literally nothing or barely anything; but a good semester would be two or four maybe. Yeah, maybe like 12...20? 12? Maybe 15 to 18 or something.

**Okay.**  

**What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Average amount of hours per week that I worked...I'm just gonna do the math. <laugh> I don't trust my estimation abilities.

I guess I can probably just say the last semester. So the entire semester, I spent around 300 hours over 90 days, so...okay, so 23 hours for school. Um, lemme just write this down...sorry. 23 hours for school plus - oh god, that's gross. 147 hours for job hunting! God fucking damn, that was a lot.  

Um, that's basically half, so I'll add like another 11 hours for club stuff, plus...oh, that. God damn it. That was probably maybe eight hours a week? And then non-clubs that was not that much, so two hours a week there. That might be a bit much. Whatever. And then research, maybe two hours or yeah.  

Interesting. It's only 42 hours? Weird. Did I do something wrong? There should be more, but I guess it's taking into account holidays and stuff. I dunno if that means anything. Oh, this might actually be more accurate: 30 plus...oh I'll also add a couple extra hours here that, um, yeah. Let's go with 55 maybe? Might still be an underestimate, 'cause I'm not taking into account walking to classes or doing other stuff like that.  

**Okay. What is the average number of rest hours you got per week in that semester?**  

Rest hours per week? It was low. Not counting sleep, I would say between 10 to 15, which I usually do on workouts.  

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

Most number hours I worked in a single week...I would not be surprised if - um, sorry, you said how much in a single week? Yeah, I'd say in the worst weeks I probably didn't have any free time. Very little free time, just for obviously eating and sleeping and so forth. I'd probably put it at...65, 75? Honestly it's probably more than that, maybe 70 to 75.  

**Could you walk me through an example of one those weeks?**  

Yes. I guess the best way to describe it is that I wouldn't have any time or energy to spend on anything that isn't just school-related stuff or surviving-related stuff. So I might get up at 9 or 10 or something, watch lectures until 1, eat some lunch, uh, do some homeworks until like maybe 4 or 5...or you know, maybe just a couple hours. And then either do club stuff in between if I can do anything online or just any work I can and need to do with that. Maybe a couple hours there. And then at five, if I have some extra time, I would just go to the gym. And if not, I would just keep working until dinner. Then after dinner, just keep working. 

<laugh> Like a bad week was just walking around to different classes, walking to meet someone to work on a project and continuing to work on that project - there was very little mental energy spent anywhere else. And then just leaving after that, yeah.  

Does that kinda answer the question, or is there anything in more depth I should talk about?  

**I think that answers it.** 

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

Mm. I think during bad semesters, not much at all. Either it was just poor time management early on that forced me to always be playing catch-up, or it was just too much and I had to keep focusing on what I was doing in order to even understand the material we were talking about in class. For easy semesters, a lot of control. I was a lot more flexible, I could go check on new places to study, spend a lot of time hanging out with people while working. I couldn't do that in a tough semester, it was mostly grind. So anytime I spend with other people I'd have to optimize to make sure I'm actually doing work. But in like other semesters, you could hang around and be like, you know, when you're doing work, but not really doing work, <laugh> just hanging out with people.  

And there was more of that, and also just having the flexibility if you wanted to, you know, try something. Like go to a new gym or check out some events or something with food, or something like that. There was always more time to play around with that. You'd have open spots in your schedule or just meet people or something like that. I think in the tough semesters that I had, it was very reactive. Reactive versus active.  

**Okay.**  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

I don't like coding as much anymore. <laugh> I don't know if this is a product of me never liking coding, or me just not liking doing projects or whatever it was. 'cause I remember in high school, I enjoyed coding. I didn't mind throwing together some short stuff and weird functions and seeing what happened. But I didn't like doing that as much in college. I never did it as much for fun. But yeah, if I took more math classes, I might actually expect that I would've liked math less, because the math classes that I took, I really didn't like...I don't know if this it's just a me thing; I prefer to learn on my own or through a textbook or something like that. So honestly I think the more time I'm forced to spend on a subject that I don't want to, or if I wanna spend more time on something but they zoom past it - which was totally the case with differential equations, 216 - then I tended to not enjoy it nearly as much and was more likely to say, "I don't want to take this subject again:.  

So the classes that didn't do this were the upper level EECS classes that were theory-focused to some degree. 'cause I really liked those, even though it was at times fast. 281 I enjoyed in the sense of like, learning about it; but I don't know if I enjoyed coding as much from it. Uh, I don't humanity stuff. I don't think my behavior's changed, I never liked it before. <laugh> But yeah, I'd say the classes where I had less agency over what I could learn and how I learned were the ones that I liked less, and for those classes my interest decreased.

Okay. I can give specific classes if you want, or more specific classes too.  

**That's fine.**

Okay.

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

I dunno how much is...okay, let's answer the question first. 

I actually don't think so. I think my energy for certain topics decreased. Like I mentioned, I enjoyed coding less. But my energy versus stuff that I was more interested in just kind of grew, and I ended up really just sticking with and enjoying stuff that I did do. Overall energy level...during tough semesters, yes, definitely I could not do anything for like a good couple weeks afterwards. Just relaxing and spending time recuperating during those two winter breaks, basically. But no, I would say that my energy level didn't seriously decrease long term.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

So is purely grade-wise? I guess, what? In terms of learning stuff? Or is there any focus?  

**Whatever you would consider results? I think most people have been talking about grades in these interviews, but if you wanna include something else in there, that's totally fine.**  

Yeah. I think grade-wise, I've been fairly consistent, even through tough semesters actually. It's kind of funny, to be honest, but yeah, definitely. It wasn't, you know, perfect. But in terms of outside of that...no, that's pretty much it academic-wise. In terms of grades, I could talk about how much I learned. I think I learned lot more during the - actually, no, I think I learned a lot basically every semester that I took stuff. I can't really say that I learned too much more in one semester than another.  

**Alright, shifting gears a little bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

I'd say that for the goals that I set...in a 90th or 95th percentile week, If I accomplish a decent-sized set of goals, then I've succeeded. So it's usually well above what I normally achieve and what I normally expect to accomplish. So I don't think I generally do accomplish what I want to do. <laugh> I think that's a fair assessment. Usually I say I wanna do something, I usually don't, but I usually make some progress or something of that sort. Either I don't start, but I do other stuff that's related to getting to that point where I can start, or - you know what I mean? So I'd say yeah, it's 90th, 95th percentile if I actually accomplish my goals.  

**Okay.**  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or especially strong student?**  

Yeah, I was a strong student in high school.  

**I know you talked a little bit about taking AP courses. Is there anything else that you wanna elaborate on in that regard?**  

Mm, I don't think I was ever like truly challenged in any math or science, really. In high school I did a bunch of math competitions, so most of the classes were a cakewalk. Science was a little bit more challenging, but it was reasonable. Like physics was fine. And when I came here, I don't think...I mean, I'm pretty confident in my ability to learn, so generally when I'm not able to learn, I usually think, "Okay, something's...uh, something's wrong with this class?" <laugh> Like for differential equations, I realized I wasn't learning anything, and then I realized, "Wait, I didn't take linear algebra. And they're doing all this weird stuff with eigenvectors and eigenvalues and I'm not sure what the fuck is happening." <laugh> So yeah, I would say that at least in terms of how strong a student I am, I'm reasonably confident in my ability to learn or catch up to a class or something like that. What other examples are there?...Uh, I think math competitions...  

I read a lot of textbooks in high school, I read a decent number of math textbooks and physics textbooks. I worked on some app - like I did some app development in high school, like mobile app development - so I had some very basic experience with coding those apps. I mean, they were terrible. <laugh> But they at least, you know, got me to the point where I'm like, "Oh, I can build something and release it, so I'm a developer, I'm a software engineer". 

So, um, yeah. Anything else?...We had all those other things, like National Honor Society and stuff like that. I was in those - it was a complete waste of time - but I guess good students do those? I dunno, it's complete nonsense for sure. <laugh> I'm kind cynical to a lot of stuff in high school in retrospect, but I think for the most part, I think it was fine and I think I did reasonably well. I guess technically I was also in our high school - we didn't do valedictorian stuff, but we did like summa cum laude. So if I remember right, I was summa cum laude. But anyways. 

**Do you or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Not by other people. There have been times where I have been trying to push myself in terms of learning some new stuff, being able to do a lot of stuff in the semester or like, build a cool app while also running some student org or while also taking difficult classes or something like that. I don't think anyone, definitely not my parents or other people I know were pushing me to be superhuman in that sense. Even for myself, I don't recall pushing myself that hard, it was just the stuff that I was interested in doing. And if I had free time, I would end up spending a lot of time with it. But no, I'd say that I didn't really get that sort of pressure or anything like that.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

Okay. Yeah, I'd say in terms of classes and courses and stuff like that, I do have like a healthy fear of failing a class, like it's enough to study or...okay, does that make sense? So for tough classes...like I think senior year first semester was the first time I was genuinely scared I would fail a class. But before that, it was more just like, "Oh, getting a bad grade is, like, not that good". So I was focusing on getting good grades, and if I did work that, in an ideal semester, got anything less than A or A-, it would be...not, not a failure, but "Could have done better" or "I wish I did better". Well, not "could have done better". So that was kind of my mindset, even an A- minus is, for some classes, kind of like, "How did you get an A- in this class?" But yeah, probably a little bit from school. So at least in terms of that, my relationship with failure was more like, "Try and just do, um, reasonably well?" And then that one class I was just like, "Please don't fail. If you get a C that's fine. Just, this is your last semester, don't fail this." <laugh> So yeah. 

In general though, I noticed that as a person, I'm a bit aversive to failure, maybe more than other people. And as a result, I think I don't take more risks that I could. At least in terms of classes, this isn't true, because I definitely took classes that were well beyond my ability; but for other sorts of stuff, I found myself that I just don't take the risks that I could take, where they would be good bets and failures would not really be that big of a deal, but yeah. I can talk more about that too, if you want.  

**I think that's good.** 

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Uh, embarrassment. I guess I never figured out a good way to not sound like an asshole, so I just dunno what to say. If I do well, um - I remember for first semester, I was taking physics 240 with a few other people. I was doing really well on the quizzes, which were pretty hard, and a lot of people weren't. It was kind of embarrassing to like...like, I don't wanna share that! Because I know people are struggling, and it's definitely not an easy class either. But how do you like...yeah, I don't know. I think in general, I think of myself as a pretty good student, even in Michigan and with a lot of the hard classes. So if someone praises me, I'll be like, "Thanks". But I don't how to actually say it in a way that's, you know...yeah.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

If it's a class that I don't care about, I will...still get surprisingly happy if I do well. I'm not sure why. I guess, you know, getting good grades is still cool to say; but it's disproportionate to how much I cared about the class. If I do well in the class that I cared about and that I was struggling in, or if I was worried and I start doing well, it's a lot more satisfying.

Satisfaction or a "This is what should have happened" kind of thing, which...is like a weird sense of entitlement, maybe, in a sense. But at least not for the classes that I think I'm doing well in. Um, yeah. What other feelings do I feel? A little bit of relief that everything is just done. <laugh> Like I don't have to think about this anymore. If a class is finally graded, or if a test is finally graded or something like that, a bit of relief, bit of triumph, a weird entitlement feeling too.   

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

When I succeed personally? Uh, I think most people - if I share, most people are pretty supportive. I mean, obviously my family's kinda supportive; but in terms of like friends and peers...generally I haven't noticed any like, super toxic reactions. My friends are pretty wholesome, so we don't usually go like, "Oh, this guy, fuck this guy, he got such a good grade". We usually don't have that kind of shit going on. So usually I think people are happy for each other if they do well. I'm pretty happy when my friends are like doing well, or if they're in a tough class and they end up scraping by or whatever it's like. Yeah.

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

I'd say it's like a feeling when you - okay. So when you're working past your limit for some period of time, after a certain point you're kind of...you kind of feel a sense of exhaustion that's different from a day to day sort of exhaustion. It's more like a long term exhaustion, and that might go away after a week, or it might like stay for much longer. It depends on how bad the initial work was that you were doing. I usually think of it, like - I don't know if this is right or not, or if this is how other people use it or not - but when people do a lot of work and then, as a result, don't wanna do work or don't have the energy to maintain that level. So they kind of drop off in performance, or they just stop doing the work, or they just like quit or take a semester off. That kind of stuff. So usually, uh, mental workload, a lot of pressure and a lot of work and a lot of like, combination of those forces.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

I guess the feeling when you feel like you're an imposter in the room. Like you shouldn't be there, you're not qualified compared to other students or other people around you, like your peers are much smarter and there's nothing you can offer. No suggestion or advice that you can offer that they couldn't, or something like that. Basically, when you feel like there's no reason why you're there, or you don't feel like you're good enough in to be in that room or something like that.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**

Not in the long term. I have been burned out after a semester, but I don't know if this is the same sort of burnout because it's never been something that was a long-term thing. Never something that lasted more than a week or two or something like that. So maybe that's just how I respond: even if it's super tough, I can bounce back quickly. Or maybe it's the fact that I haven't really had a super difficult semester. If I have like a work semester or a work week or, you know, work month or whatever, that's super tough and I'm constantly grinding and there's a lot of stress, a lot of pressure - then maybe after that, I'd be out for a month or two or maybe longer or whatever. I don't know. But yeah, as of now, I would say that anything that I've had is probably 80th, 90th percentile in terms of like how good it compares to the rest of the population. At least in terms of who's taken my level of workload and the resulting level of burnout afterwards. I'd say I've probably responded better than average.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

I don't think I have. Um, I could elaborate. 

There's never been a class I've been in where I feel like I don't deserve to be there. Part of it is that I do have a bit of an ego when it comes to classes. <laugh> Even if I'm not doing well; then I'll be just like, "Fuck this, I'm just gonna figure it out", and I'll eventually get to the point where I can understand what's going on. I might have been closer to imposter syndrome when I was doing research with some smart professors or PhD students, and I'm like, "I don't know what I'm doing". But I think I genuinely didn't know what I was doing, so I don't know if I can really say that it was imposter syndrome rather than just me learning the ropes and getting up to speed. Something like that. It would be a stretch, in my opinion, to call that imposter syndrome. Maybe an outside observer would know more.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I have friends who took very easy semesters after very difficult semesters. I would suspect that maybe it's not "true" burnout or whatever. Maybe I'd say...okay, I'd say out of my closest acquaintances, maybe three to four out of 10 have taken pretty easy semesters after difficult semesters. I don't know if maybe they just wanted an easier semester or something of that sort. I know I'm not like a particularly, uh - what do you call it, a random sample? A representative sample. Like the students that I'd be interacting with are students who are taking the hardest classes around. So probably in general, burnout might be a little bit less prevalent compared to my group. But even then, burnout's not a visible thing, obviously. Maybe people are burnt out, but don't show it. So yeah, if I was to start with an estimate, I might say for the people among my peers, maybe like 30% to 40%. And then maybe more if it's that people's burnout isn't visible, or maybe less if it's like, um...well, class workload might not represent burnout. People who take easy classes might not have been burnt out, but just wanted a little bit of a change.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?** 

That's a good question. I'd say of the people who I'd talked with and hung around, it would be a little bit less common than burnout. Because I've met those people who are, um...to be honest, maybe it's an "Asian male in engineering" kind of thing where a lot of people wouldn't feel imposter syndrome, because it's kind of like, you know, "your" demographic. If people are coming from other demographics, they, uh, might be more intimidated and they might feel more imposter syndrome. So I'd probably say whatever I've experienced might be like, 20th percentile in terms of the number of people who would actually experience it. So, okay - I'd say I've seen maybe, maybe one in one in 10, maybe one in 20 people I know who have shown some sort of imposter syndrome, maybe higher than that. Maybe one in five or one in four, in terms of like people who are - these are just numbers outta my ass, aren't they? <laugh>, But yeah, if I wanted to start at my number and then adjust up depending on the rest of the people, I'll probably say something like that. But those numbers are probably not too...right. Um, yeah. 

Yeah, I would say like maybe 20% or 25% of people.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Uh, for burnout, COVID-19 was pretty much orthogonal. I don't think COVID had any strong effect because for me personally, none of my family got COVID or were at any big risk if they did. They weren't particularly immunocompromised. I mean, they're older, right, but once the vaccines happened, they weren't that much at risk compared to other people. So I'd say for me personally, burnout was not affected much at all by COVID. I know that's probably different for other people, but not, not too much for me. Imposter syndrome, same thing. I guess going to class over Zoom and interacting with people over Zoom didn't exhaust me and didn't burn me out or anything of that sort. Like I'm a bit introverted, so I'm fine if I interact with people over Zoom; I definitely prefer in-person, but I don't lose too much in my opinion. So I'd say that it didn't affect me that much. Probably a 20th percentile experience, maybe 10th, 15th percentile experience compared to other experiences.  

**Alright. Considering everything we've talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yes. I enjoyed it a lot more after my third semester, once I started taking classes that I actually enjoyed. Taking a class that I wanted to take definitely made it a lot more enjoyable. And even before, I still liked a lot of classes, but yes. I think computer science was pretty cool.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Not at all. Maybe two teachers in my high school mentioned them at some point, but I didn't give much attention to it at all.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Uh, in terms of burnout, I'd say take, um, <laugh> think about taking easier classes. That 281 / 370 / 376 semester was completely pointless! So yeah. Think about what classes you wanna take, and plan so that you have a little bit of slack, a little bit of free time to explore other clubs and stuff, where you're not forced to constantly play catch up and just keep doing work, cuz that shit's just not...it's a bad semester. In terms of imposter syndrome, um...have that huge-ass fucking ego that you have? <laugh> Take the classes that you think you should be taking, even if advisors say that you can't or you shouldn't. 

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**    

I don't think so. I think it's cool that you're doing this. I'm really curious what the general survey or what other interviews are gonna say, so it'll definitely be cool to see that. I dunno if I have anything for me particularly, cause I kind of talked about stuff in high school. COVID is definitely a big thing. But yeah, those were the big things. Like I guess at a high level, I don't know if I'm a great source of data points because, uh, I think I haven't experienced these as much as other people may have. But maybe this is a useful data point, so sure.  

**Cool. That wraps up the interview. I'll stop recording there.**
