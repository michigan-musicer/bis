**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

I went to one of the highest rated public high schools in the state of Michigan. Obviously it's public school, but it was still very competitive. It was a school of choice, and people would come out of their way from pretty far away - I had a few friends who drove 45 minutes to get to the school in the morning, pretty wacky. But that school was pretty hyper-competitive, so I was already kind of prepared for the environment when I came here.  

That's about it, I don't really know anything else specifically to say. I took a lot of AP classes in high school as well, which I regret because none of the credits transferred in anything I ended up using; but some of the classes were pretty interesting. At least I didn't think that high school was that bad. I'm not one of those people who hated high school.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Peers to me just means coworkers. And I would probably say like, oh god, a lot. <laugh> I'd say basically everybody in my studio for music school that's in my grade, although I'd also probably count people in the grades below me as well. I specifically wouldn't count people who were above me. Obviously they graduated last semester, but I had a lot of trouble communicating with people who were a higher grade than me because of the whole merit perspective to the music school. But for the engineering school, my peers would basically just be anybody who was on the team with me that I was working on at that time. Or people nearby me in class who I'd ask questions to a lot.

So it was a very loose declaration that I kind of just gave to people, you know?  

**Okay. How many years have you been in your major?**  

This will be my fourth year.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your majors?**  

So I actually have known that I wanted to do something with rockets since I was literally six years old. As soon as I discovered that model rockets were a thing, I started making those like, as a kid. And as soon as I discovered that you can make things that are more powerful than that, I started trying to, uh, get creative. I got yelled at by my parents for trying to cook engines on our stove grill a few times. So yeah, I've been doing that for a while. For my instrument, I started it pretty young. Well, I started piano when I was four, so I'd already had a lot of experience with music. I started my current instrument in fourth grade and I was playing it all the way through high school, and I thought it was fun - I thought that I was not amazingly good at it, but I had a lot of talent at it, even though I didn't practice that much.  

So I thought it'd be interesting to see how far I could go with it, especially because my teacher back in high school at the time always mentioned that there are a lot of people who play my instrument, but there are very few people who play it well. So I was very curious how far I could get if I actually decided to take it further. With that mentality though, it was more of just a question - it was an experiment. So when I was applying to colleges, the only college that I actually applied to for music was UofM; everything else I only applied to for engineering. And it just so happened that I got into UofM for engineering and for music, and UofM was my number two. In reality, my number one would've been something like MIT, but I never even applied in the end because I found out that they specifically discourage lineage, and my mom went there and I think her brother also went there. So I was like, "Alright, there's no fucking chance".  

**What is your most memorable story about academics at UofM?**  

Academics? I'd say probably when I had to drop calc four. I've still never gotten a C in a class; I think the lowest grade that I've gotten so far is a B-, I think. I don't know - but the point is, every single semester since freshman year, I was doing 20 credits. Obviously with music school shenanigans, I was making it look like it was a lot less than 20 credits as far as UofM was concerned, so I didn't have to pay extra; but it definitely started wearing down on me more. When the classes started getting more difficult sophomore year, especially 'cause sophomore year you start getting all those 200 weed-out classes - which for my engineering major were really bad because, there's a lot of people who just get in because they go "Man, I wanna do something that looks impressive", and then they realize that they can't do it. So we have a lot of those kind of classes, and it was really hard to do in my schedule on top of music.
 
And I realized that second semester sophomore year, I had been going at this for a while and I was really running out of steam. I remember that I had a few assignments on calc four that I just wasn't understanding. I'm pretty bad at math by itself. Like if you put it in a physics environment, I can suddenly understand it, but if you leave it by itself, I just can't really grasp why I need to care; so it was just very difficult for me to focus. Then on top of that, it just didn't start going well. I started doing the math and I realized that I didn't think I'd be able to actually do well in the class unless I was able to get an insanely good grade on the first midterm.  

Then I just kind of bombed it, and I remember I had to call my mom afterwards and I was "Yeah, no, I can't do this". And then I had to reach out to the professor and the professor asked, "Is there anything you wanna do to try and make it work better?" And I looked at her and I said "I calculated the math, and unless you curve this test 50% or 60%, there is no way that I could physically pass. So I'm just gonna drop." And the math professor was very respectful; she understood that it was a situation that a lot of people go through. But because of that, I had to start taking summer classes, and I had to take summer classes both semesters over the summer. So when you include the fact that that year was no breaks because of COVID, I had straight classes with no break over a week from January to Thanksgiving break. And that was very hard. That was very rough. Obviously winter break came around, and then after that I had second semester of junior year, and that's why this summer I'm only taking one class right now. 

My parents are trying to get me to do a job or take another course on top of that, and I'm straight up telling them that I will *die*. <laugh> Even though my last semester was a lot more low in credits, I think...I realized when I was taking that semester - I mean, I say lower in credits when it's 17, but the difference is that it's actually 17. No music school shenanigans, it's actually 17. So even though it's technically the lightest semester I've ever had since coming here, it kind of revealed that I'm the kind of person who, um, I only work up to the amount of work that I need to do. So if I'm taking one class over the summer, then I'm gonna barely work at it until I actually have to, which is a really bad habit, but that's just kind of the way that I work. So I think I realize a lot more that there's a lot of things that I wanna do outside of class when I had the free time to suddenly realize that. So yeah, it's interesting. Just trying to figure out what I wanna really do. 

But my desire to pursue the majors that I've been going after has not changed.  

**Okay.**  

**What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in an average semester?**  

What kind of work? Are you saying in-class time plus homework plus studying for exams plus taking exams outside of class? Stuff like that?  

**It's up to you what you wanna consider work.**

Okay. I think I'd have to pull up some old schedules, but before last semester, I think I was averaging about five hours in class a day. Then on top of that, if you count weekends to spread out the amount of time I was doing the homework, I would probably say that I was doing, maybe - 'cause the thing is, I didn't have a *lot* of homework assignments, but they were huge. They're so big that you're expected to work in groups, and it's assumed that you work in groups because you can't really do them by yourself. I think I'd say probably seven hours a day. Maybe eight, but nothing ridiculous or crazy. I'm just not the kind of person who's great with long extended loads.  

But yeah, I'd say seven or eight hours a day.  

**Is that on top of the five in class or including it?**  

Yes, that's including the five in class. So it's two hours outside of class, five hours in class. And I'm not including practicing, because practicing's two and a half hours on top of that every day.  

**So hang on, there's that. So five plus two or three, plus two and half is.**..  

So you're looking at nine and a half if you include practice.  

**Okay. So around 10 per day, so 70 per week?**  

60, 70, I guess. Something like that during the normal semesters. Last semester, I was probably closer to 50, because I had a much more reasonable schedule. And then right now I'm doing - fuck, maybe 10, 15, maybe? I don't know. I have a really bad habit with EECS projects; like I have one due Wednesday that I haven't started yet. I was gonna look at it later today, even though I'm on two and a half hours of sleep, so it'll be interesting to see how that goes. But yeah, as I mentioned before, I have a nasty habit of only allocating myself the minimum amount of required time to technically finish. 'cause that's the only way that I can reasonably get through everything.   

Like nowadays I should probably switch to giving myself more time, but back in freshman and sophomore year, I literally couldn't. If I tried to give everything as much time as I could, I would literally never leave my apartment. <laugh>   

**What is the average number of rest hours you got per week in an average semester?**  

By rest, are you including video games?

**Whatever you would consider rest. I would say just not work, but up to what you consider rest.**  

Okay, not work. Let's see...if I'm saying that I am working, if you're including in-class, practicing, and schoolwork and we're saying that I'm doing that...what did we say? Eight to 10 hours a day on average? I think I was pretty strict on the rougher semesters about getting around seven hours of sleep every night, but it bumped around pretty drastically. So if you keep that in mind, 24 minus seven, uh, 17 hours a day. So I spend about 10 hours at work, so I'd say seven hours. I'm definitely the type who tries to cram as much as I can into a small amount of time, so I'd say that almost every second that I wasn't working, I was taking a break in some capacity. I'm very much a proponent of taking a lot of breaks.  

**Okay, so then 49-ish hours of waking rest?**  

Like 50, yeah. I'm not an amazingly structured person, so these are all kind of estimates. But yeah, 50 hours a week sounds pretty accurate.  

**What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Okay. My busiest semester would probably...I don't know, 'cause for me, individual classes are usually a lot more taxing than the actual semester itself. I think. My hardest semester, I distinctly remember that I'd be staying up until, like - because this class that I was taking had a really wacky late policy where every single hour that you turn it in late, you'd take off a percent. So I remember that I would distinctly stay up until 3:00 AM, 4:00 AM with a fucking shirt over my eye because my eye started hurting looking at the screen, so that I could try and get this assignment done. But I don't think that it was actually any more than the other semesters necessarily, because it was just divvied up differently, if that makes sense. So probably still that same, like whatever I said before, 70 hours a week-ish.  

**Okay. And then for rest hours, would I assume same-ish?**  

Yeah, maybe lower. There were a few weeks actually that I remember recently where I didn't get to play video games for an entire week. I did other things, but I was definitely close to 10 or 20 hours of break once or twice over the past few weeks. Oh, not past few weeks, but that I can remember - so maybe fall last year or something like that. I don't remember what semester it was exactly.  

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

Most hours that I worked in a single week...well for a recent example - I can't tell you the exact number off the top of my head - but I can tell you for a recent example, the euchre project was due two weeks ago on Friday. I started that on, I wanna say the Tuesday of that week, because I'm stupid; and I worked on it...I remember I did the math on it because I was operating under the philosophy that if I would give myself enough time, I would eventually get it. Um, I actually was not able to figure it out. I'm pretty bad at coding, I feel like I've made that clear before! <laugh> Sp I spent as much time as I wanted to on that. I still couldn't really get it to work.  

But over four days I put about 50 hours in the project, just in four days, which when you think about it, that's 96 hours. That's a lot of time to put in 96 hours, but that's just a recent example I can give. I don't actually know necessarily. Okay, there might have been weeks sophomore or freshman year where I spent - 'cause my engineering major has these stupid four to five hour labs. It's very possible that I spent extra time in one of those multiple times a week or something freshman or sophomore year and just didn't realize it because I was chilling with my teammates the whole time. It's much easier when you're in a group, because you can talk with people and relax and not think about how much time you're actually spending doing what you're doing. But yeah.  

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I think I have a lot of control. I think I'm one of those people who likes making time appear out of thin air, so I usually think that I have a lot of control over my time. It's usually a question of "Can I reasonably get the work done if I'm given enough time?" For example, what I was just pointing out is I'm not really good at coding. So the answer for that case is no. I could give myself as much time as I want, and as long as I'm not running into office hours, yelling at the teacher constantly, I'm not gonna get it. But typically for physics problems, absolutely. I can sit there, I can crunch away at it for days, and eventually I'll get it. But generally, I feel like I have a lot of control over my time.  

 If I mess up timing something, it's entirely on me. I probably could have done it differently. Very rarely am I in the mindset that I am getting fucked by circumstance, you know what I mean?  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Absolutely. I think being here for three years now really does a number on you. I remember when I came in freshman year, I was thinking I could do a master's as well, or I can possibly do something after college as well. And then over time, that just slowly eroded. Like freshman year I was thinking I'm gonna get some nice internships, I'm gonna have a ton of job opportunities lined up, I'm gonna go try and work at Lockheed or something after college, and that'll be sick, it'll be lots of fun. Then every single year as I kept taking more and more classes, especially after first semester of junior year - that's two and a half years into the school year, right? Everybody else is already saying "Aight, I only have three more semesters", and then I'm sitting there saying "I'm *halfway*". <laugh> And that was the moment for me where I decided there is absolutely no way I'm ever doing any more school in the rest of my life. Because you spend what, 18 years? No, 16 years in school, if you just do a normal bachelor's. I'm gonna be doing 17. If you do a master's, you're spending 18 - if you do SUGS then 17 as well, but the point still stands. That's a really big portion of your life! I view your twenties as the most important time of your life, so I feel like you should spend it doing what you genuinely want to do. In that perspective, I want to try and get out of college. <laugh> Like I don't wanna be spending my entire life in a classroom.  

There definitely was a point though, freshman year, where if you asked me, I would be totally chill with doing that. But I think as time has gone on and it started wearing on me a little bit more - I've definitely been telling my parents: part of the reason why I want to join the air force is...I wanna join the military because I wanna be in a situation where I don't have to think for myself very much. 'cause you constantly have time schedules, you have dates, you have deadlines, everything looming over your head constantly that you have to manage, put together and stuff like that. 

And it's not actually that amazingly difficult to do. It's just that for me, at least, it's very taxing. I found that trying to put together an assignment where it's not structured, where you don't have a resume or anything like that - like I think trying to put together my music recital was probably the most taxing thing I've ever done. Which is weird because I did something that I've always been doing, you know, you just down, you play some music, then you clap and everybody leaves. But sitting down, trying to figure out the rep you wanna play, getting in contact with everybody, renting out the room, renting out the accompanist, trying to get everybody to show up and then explaining to my professor what I wanna play, trying to see it actually come to fruition, especially when you're doing something like a small ensemble or quintet or something like I did at the end of mine - that kind of stuff to me is incredibly draining. So I just want to be in an environment where it's like, "Shut up and do what you're told", you know? <laugh> 

Not for necessarily that long. I'm trying to go for being a pilot. If I end up being a pilot, then I'll be in for 10 years minimum, which kind of sucks. But that's what they do, and they also get a pilot license out of it. So I can leave the air force and then go, "Hey, I can fly planes now", and that sounds pretty cool. But obviously if they don't let me be a pilot because I'm too tall or my vision's shit, something like that - I'm gonna try and get LASIK [laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, commonly referred to as laser eye surgery], so I don't know. But if they do something like that, I'm still gonna serve. It's just gonna be a different occupation, so I'll be like, logistics or some shit. But yeah, I definitely got sick. I've definitely gotten really sick of academia, and I'm pretty happy to be in a situation now where I'm separating myself from school in a way. That's why I'm trying to do stuff like bike more - I randomly went to a nearby town two nights ago - and stuff like trying to get into exercising a little bit more and being a little bit more healthy outside of school. Yeah.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

I don't know. Honestly, I'm the kind of person who thinks that I never change, but then I also look back and realize that almost every single value that I held freshman year I disagree with now. So I don't really know how I can have that opinion, but I feel that I've always been this weird, lazy, hard worker, if that makes sense. Like only a hard worker when I absolutely have to, and avoiding it like the plague if I can get away with it, if I don't have to. I feel like that mentality hasn't really changed. I think the only difference is that now, I get punished more for it, 'cause I'm not a freshman anymore. <laugh>    

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

I guess? I don't really know, actually. Well, yes, but in a weird way, I think my GPA per semester has always been about the same, but I've noticed that freshman year, my music grades were lower and I was being carried by my engineering classes. And as time has gone by, that has switched, and now I'm being carried by my music grades and my engineering grades are going down. <laugh> I don't really know why that is. I think it's probably just because I'm finally getting through all the weed-outs. You have to realize: I took my first 300-level major course in engineering last semester, because that's just how five year degrees work. So I was still taking weed-outs until winter last year, so to some extent I feel like it was moderately expected. But I don't know. Apparently my upper level engineering courses are supposed to just hand out As for being there, so I'm hoping for that. But obviously, if I'm gonna be doing military after college, my GPA really doesn't matter. So it's kind of hard to keep the energy up.  

**Okay. Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

I'm the type who generally has very arbitrary but understandable goals. They're not things that I could necessarily explain to you, but I think that they make sense in my head. And...I think I purposefully never actually achieve them. I get moderately close and then I just move the bar further. I like to call myself a personal perfectionist in that I'm never really satisfied with how I am at any time, and I always try to improve myself in any way that I can deem necessary to get better at something. So I don't really know if that answers your question. Does that work? I don't know.  

**I guess that works.**  

Yeah. I set goals that are arbitrary, only understandable to me, and not exactly achievable. And then whenever I get close to actually achieving them, I push them forward.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yes. Before UofM, in high school, I only ever actually got a B twice, and it was because of fucking Spanish! <laugh> I think before college I would've been considered in one of the upper echelons; but at my high school, at least, 4.0s were not rare. I remember at my high school, I was actually looked down upon for only having a 1540 on my SAT, stuff like that. My high school was very elitist like that.  

But yeah, I think back then, I definitely would've been considered one of the smarter kids, whereas over here I'm definitely considered one of the...not necessarily as, uh, immediately catching on constantly. That's part of the reason why I don't really know if I want to work in an office job that much, 'cause I don't think it's necessarily the right occupation for me. It seems like looking around and talking to other people who are also doing my major, there's a lot of people who are way quicker to understand the situation and way faster to propose ideas that it would probably think up, but would take me like 15 more minutes. <laugh> I feel like I could keep up with everyone in my class, but, I mean, I don't really know if it's necessarily efficient from a job or occupation perspective.  

Like if a company's looking for people, they'd probably want to go to one of them before me. But if they wanted somebody who's very team-oriented, who has very good communication skill, then they could come to me. But unfortunately, I feel like it's very hard to relay in the engineering world how ridiculously important cooperation and communication is in the music world. So I'll write on my resumes and stuff that I have a lot of experience in music and that, well, that transfers over and that I'm really good with group work and I'm really good in understanding other people and trying to get things done. But I'm not great with words, so it's really hard for me to explain it without talking to them directly, because - this is generally just how I talk. Even when I'm being interviewed, this is how I talk. I don't really put on fake personas, and I'm pretty proud of that.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

A little bit. I get that vaguely from my parents, but I think that they understand that it's kind of ridiculous.  

Whenever I genuinely do pretty poorly in a class or something, I think it's very obvious that the first assumption amongst my parents is that it's the environment around me that's discouraging me for being able to do it, and they think that I should be able to do it. But when I explain that more of the time it's just a question of commitment and understanding, like - theoretically, if I devoted every millisecond of my life, I might be able to get much higher grades than I do. But I have absolutely no desire to do that. <laugh> 'cause I feel like that's just a great way to absolutely lose five years of my life. So I think there's an understanding of that with my family, at least. I've openly looked at my parents before and my mom says, "You know, you could do so much better if you just put in a lot more effort" and I go, "I could, I could, but at what cost?" And I think that my parents kind of think that I'm lazy for that, but I think that it's an accomplishment myself that I can accept that that's how I work and not try to push myself over what I know is reasonable.  

But yeah, a little bit. Not nearly as bad as I've heard a lot of people have it.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

I don't think I outright fail often. I'm the type who, whenever I mess up, I always try to pull at straws and say "But actually, I didn't completely mess up", or find some excuses as to where I could possibly use it again in the future. So I don't know. I feel like for failure, it's much more readily common in my music side than it is on my engineering side for sure. As I mentioned before with the calc thing, I think that's the only really big time that I've just straight up...actually had something that I failed so badly that I had to sit down and accept that I failed it. Whereas with music, I think that you're in an environment where you're constantly surrounded by people who are way better than you and everybody's constantly improving.

And myself, every summer I have something that just stops me from playing. I haven't picked up my my instrument in over a month now just because of this fucking surgery, and I have a cold sore on my lip and I can't play. So it feels like every semester, I come in, everybody sounds way better than they used to, and I'm just exactly where I was before. I don't know. I feel that...I don't know if necessarily that would be considered failure, but yeah.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I take it. I kind of hate people who try to deny praise. I think that's kind of a dick move to whoever you're talking to, 'cause it puts the other person in a position of like, "Well, what do you want me to say?" <laugh> If somebody has praise for me, I'm assuming that they're saying it meaningfully. I try to avoid people who give empty statements.       

Obviously it's hard to tell sometimes when you know, more intelligent people are giving empty statements. But I feel like if somebody does it regularly enough, you can tell that they don't mean what they're saying, and I usually try to avoid those people. I'm very straightforward, and I absolutely loathe passive-aggressive people who give empty statements like that. So I generally try to stay as far as possible from people like that. So usually when people give me compliments, I take them meaningfully.

And I try to give them myself too.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

I feel like it's kind of the expectation. The assumption of what level of success I think is the difference. If I get what I'm going for, you know, like the minimum A- to count as an A - if I get that, I just kind of go, "Yeah, that's expected". If I get a little bit below that, like if I get a B+ or a B or something like that, I'm just kinda like, "Alright, whatever". Freshman year I used to care a lot, and I think that as time has gone on, I just stopped caring. My parents still get really mad at me whenever I get Bs, but my GPA's fine. I don't think it really matters that much. I'm just trying to get through college. But, um...I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?  

Oh, okay. I only have genuine feelings of...meaningful improvement, when it's a ridiculous success that was more built off of my ability to make time than because I was actually working insanely hard at it. I personally am not a fan of throwing your heart and soul into something and then watching it succeed; I feel like that's kind of inefficient. I generally try to, as I've laid out before, put in the minimum that I can to get what I want. So when I get what I want, it's like, "Alright, cool, that's expected". But then when I get a lot more than what I want, it's pretty rewarding. I don't know, I don't necessarily get that same, like, dopamine rush from grades anymore. In high school I would show it to my parents and they'd be like, "Oh cool", and then I'd stop caring about it and forget about it completely. But nowadays I only really get that kind of self-fulfillment from exercise or improving at a video game that I have thousands of hours in. I don't really get that from schoolwork anymore. Schoolwork's just kind of my job, that's what it feels like. Especially with music, it's an expectation, you know?  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

When I succeed? I'll be honest: I really don't think they care. <laugh> Because again, in my engineering major, I literally don't think that people even know when I succeed. But in music school, it's definitely...it's always been a weird situation where I feel like I'm doing a lot better, and then I'll play something that I feel is really good, and then I'll finish it afterwards and everybody will just say "Yeah, solid performance". It's like, "Is that all you have to say? Did you like the sound or anything like that?" And they're like, "Oh yeah, that's a good sound, solid performance". And I'm like, "What's wrong with it?!" And they're like, "I don't know, it's fine". It's like, I feel that I just didn't capture their attention or something like that. I don't really know what it is, but it definitely feels like people don't really notice when I accomplish something.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah, of course.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Running at 110% for so long that you fall off the tracks. I mean, it's basically just not taking breaks, right? That's why I've been a massive proponent of taking breaks ever since high school, because I just wouldn't have made it to now with my family trying to impose as high of like, requirements on me in school ever since high school that I've had till now.

I developed a lot of mentalities about the way that I approach doing schoolwork and stuff that encouraged me to take a lot of breaks. If you try to get through work without taking breaks, you just end up spending more time on the work for the same results. So it's just a really bad plan. But I definitely think that there's a difference between temporary burnout and long-term burnout, and I think that that's a distinction that people don't really talk about. It's this idea of burning out from day to day, you know, like when you get back from your work or you get back from your classes and you sit down, you do your work, and then you're really tired. And then you go to bed and you wake up the next day and you feel fulfilled. That's daily burnout, when you're just trying to slog through and it's hard to get through, but you're still doing it and you just kind of like - you hate it, but you're doing it.

But I think that there's a long-term burnout where it's like - it's not actually individually, day-to-day that I'm actually getting exhausted or anything. I'm sleeping a lot besides last night. <laugh> But I'm normally sleeping a lot and I'm normally exercising, I'm normally improving, and normally getting things done that I want to do. It's just this idea of...it's like the more existential issues, you know? Like what the hell am I doing here for so long? Why does society encourage us to stay in school until we're past the point where we would normally have kids biologically, you know? What's the point in doing all this junk when you could very easily just graduate from high school and not care anymore? Especially in the US, there's a lot of places that'll take you even without a high school diploma, which is kind of wacky to think about. But obviously we don't look into it very much because we operate under the assumption that you have one.

But yeah. I would say short-term burnout is not something that I think...I think that that's the more common issue for college students, like the thing that people are sitting around and going, "Man, I can't get through these assignments, this is getting really hard, everything's piling up and I'm just starting to not care". But for me, I think it's more along the lines of "This multi year-long experience, I'm kind of starting to care less and less and less about what I'm doing". So yeah.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Trying to be somebody you're not, or you're trying to force yourself into an image that you want, but you're not necessarily great at. I feel like it's a pretty common thing in the art world, especially doing music and stuff like that, to look at others, see what they're doing, and say, "I want that". And then you try to run in, you try to get that, and then you realize you can't and it's trying to chase after an image that doesn't exist.

I don't know. I think that personally, that's not really an issue for me, but I definitely see it around me a lot - a lot of people trying to figure out what they want to be and trying to distance themselves from their family to figure out what they actually want to be. Because obviously your parents only want what's best for you, but they also have a predisposition for what they would want to be if they were in your shoes, and they try to force that on kids *a lot*. So it's trying to figure out what you actually want to be and part of doing that is getting away from your family. That's why I feel like dorms for college is so important. I live less than an hour away, but I don't live in my parents' place.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yes, currently. <laugh> Every day. I mentioned though, it's not the day-to-day thing. It's much more like the long-term deal, and it hasn't really gotten to the point where I'd openly call it burnout until recently.

**You elaborated on it quite a bit; is there any more that you wanna mention there, or do you think you've already covered the full story?**  

I don't think that there is much more to say. It's just...it's not a simple "work too hard to ratio of play" thing, it's not like that. It's more like an existential burnout, like "What's the point? Why am I doing this? Is it actually gonna be worth it in the end? Hopefully I actually use these degrees." You know? And what else..."What's my opportunity cost? What could I be doing instead?" It's not necessarily because of an improper delegation of time, I'd say.  

And it's not something that can be solved by switching majors, because I know a lot of people are doing that, but that would not work for me. I know that I want to do what I'm currently looking at doing; it's just a question of how long I'm willing to spend to get there.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

No. I have an image in my head of myself that's pretty stagnant, and I think that I've had an established individual personality for a very long time. I think that the reason for that is actually kind of messed up. When I was a kid, I just didn't have friends. <laugh> I literally spent until, I'd say, about seventh grade alone. 

I talked to people in school, but I didn't have friends. I'd say my first actual friends were made in seventh and eighth grade, so that entire period before then, it was just me by myself, and I established a pretty strong identity during that time. I think a lot of other people are worried about making friends in that time, and they don't like the fact that they were alone; but looking back at it, I was never really sad about it, so I didn't really understand what I was missing out on. That's just kind of the way I lived, and I think that I established a pretty strong individual personality, which I've kept too. As I mentioned before, I don't typically think of myself as somebody who changes a lot, even though I don't hold a single view that I had five years ago. So yeah.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers? Both the day-to-day and the existential burnout that you're talking about.**  

Existential I think is an issue that almost every single college student will get to in some capacity. I think it varies by what you're doing - I feel that people who are in majors which aren't necessarily guaranteed to make a lot of money after college are a lot more predisposed to an existential style of burnout. So your artists, your musicians, your writers, your, uh, I don't know, gender equality major? Isn't that a major? Something like that on central, one of the things that you don't necessarily need a major to do well in, you know what I mean? Like for music school, I know a lot of people who I'm friends with who are like, "Man, I might just not finish the music degree". And you ask, "Why would you not finish the music degree? You've been here forever." And he goes, "Because in the music world, they don't care about if you have a piece of paper, they care about how you sound". 

It's much easier to get into the state of "Why the fuck am I here?" when the piece of paper you're working so hard for is basically meaningless. Part of the reason why I was so focused on trying to actually complete my music major originally was because I had this idea that I wanted to be a musician and an engineer and possibly a soldier down the line, and I didn't know if I'd be able to call myself a musician if I didn't have the piece of paper. But the longer I go on, the more I realize that most famous musicians don't have that piece of paper. So I feel like the existential form is much more common than the day-to-day form, and I think that people only look at the day-to-day form because it's very easy to look at somebody and see they're not doing well, you know? 'cause it's very easy to see somebody who's working way too hard and then watch them crash.  

I don't think that it's very easy to see people who are just trying to find meaning in what they do every day. If that answers your question. 

**I think you touched on this earlier, but how prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

I think imposter syndrome is actually - I think it's prevalent. I don't think it's as big of an issue as it's socially made out to be, but that might just be because of my own predisposition, because as I mentioned before, I've always had a very strong individual idea of myself. So trying to imagine myself in a situation where I don't have that is kind of hard to go with. Like I hear people complaining about it a lot, but at the same time, most of the people who are complaining about it do have...a unique image to me. It's this weird idea of how many people who think they have it actually have it, you know? Especially in the modern internet culture where people love to self-diagnose themselves with mental illnesses to try and join groups in some kind of messed up way. How many people can you actually say have something like that and mean it? I think that it *is* a high number, I think it is an issue, but I don't think it's as prevalent of an issue as, I would say, burnout, for example. Although I don't even know how you'd address that. I don't know what you do for that.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Hmm. Obviously imposter syndrome, it hasn't made a difference. Burnout though...I don't know. It might have made it worse? I couldn't tell you without also experiencing college without it - like I don't have a sample study, I don't have a base case. I think that in a lot of ways, COVID made the working environment a lot harder, 'cause you had to do a lot more work, usually online, and a lot of teachers took that as an excuse to slap on way more work. 

This wasn't nearly as bad in the engineering department as it was in the music world, but oh my goodness, man, some of the musicology professors went absolutely nuts. Once they understood that everybody was only gonna watch the lectures online, they started recording extra lectures that you had to watch, they started adding extra content on top of shit they wouldn't normally do, because...they legitimately like what they teach. It's just that they put a lot of extra work on people when they accepted that people will watch their videos at 2x speed. Like there were classes I took where they were written around the assumption that you watch their lectures at 2x speed, and I mean, I do that, but if you start working your class around that, that means the average person who doesn't do that is gonna *die*. <laugh> I feel like you're gonna have a lot more cases of that day-to-day burnout. I know one of my friends had a lot of issues with that sophomore year, because it got really rough for a while, just because COVID let professors get away with murder.  

But at the same time, there were also a lot of classes that were made a lot easier because of COVID. For example, I had a design class where we were supposed to have three projects, but the professor got his timeline so fucked up because of COVID that he was only able to make two of them. The second one was huge, don't get me wrong - it was bigger than most final projects in the course. But it doesn't change the fact that in order to try and restructure, that class was accidentally made a lot easier. I don't know if I could say without also taking everything in-person if it was easier or necessarily harder, and also if it would encourage or discourage either of those, uh, disorders. I don't know if we call them disorders, maybe conditions.  

**Well, we're close to wrapping up here. Considering everything we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

To some extent. I think it's useful. I don't hate it. Every once in a while, I will get a moment where I legitimately do enjoy what I'm doing a lot. But I think the longer I spend in school, the longer the time between those. But I don't usually have time where I'm sitting in a class and I legitimately just hate it.

Especially as I take fewer and fewer general ed credits - even with coding, I don't actually hate it. I'm just bad at it. <laugh> All the classes that I was legitimately hating, like pure math and stuff like that, I stopped taking a while ago because I just got through them all. So the highs aren't as high, but the lows are definitely not nearly as low. <laugh> So yeah, generally it's okay.

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I feel that they've kind of become social buzzwords. I feel like everybody mentions them a lot. Especially back in my high school where burnout was such an issue that like, once every three or four years, some kid would kill themselves. My high school had a ridiculously competitive culture that encouraged people to do stupid stuff like that, so I'd already heard of these things a long time before coming to college. Obviously high school is a lot easier than college. But yeah, I had known about them for a very long time before coming to college.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and/or burnout?**  

I'd probably say that trying to use music school shenanigans to make classes fit is not the answer. And if you need to - because I don't really have much of an issue with imposter syndrome, but for burnout at least, I think that pacing...not necessarily my workload per semester, but the actual number of classes per semester would be very advantageous. Especially freshman and sophomore year, I was taking about six classes a semester, which is just too much. I can do it - 'cause I did it - but looking back on it, especially when I only took four or five classes last semester, it's so much nicer that if I had the opportunity to go back, I would try and tell myself to distribute my load more evenly. I would say...because I don't think I'm gonna get an internship before I graduate, so I'd probably say "You're not gonna get an internship. Expect that, don't overload yourself the beginning, just push stuff into the summer and take it slow."

That's what I would say.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Not particularly, I don't think.  

**Alright, that is a wrap. Thank you for participating and I'll stop recording here.**
