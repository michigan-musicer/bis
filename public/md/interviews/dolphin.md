**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Before Michigan, I went to a high school in a different state. In terms of my education there, it was very straightforward, very standard, typical high school education with your core subjects: math, science, social studies, and English, all of those classes. Certain requirements depending on your grade and depending on your academic standing. Extracurriculars...I did band; that was my main focus throughout high school. I found the most enjoyment in that, I'd say, out of most of the subjects. <laugh> Yeah, pretty standard.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Hmm. I'd say maybe three people - in terms of my close peers, I'd say three people at most. Generally I would say that I have a pretty large group of people that I consider friends, but three people who I consider to be very close.  

**Okay.**  

**How many years have you been your major?**  

About to be four.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

So when I was in high school, I was studying privately with a teacher. Thankfully I was able to study with her through this program that I was a part of in high school, which, um, its central focus was trying to give underrepresented musicians in high school, specifically black and Latinx, the opportunities that they may or may not be able to get because of, like, a plethora of different things related to demographics or economic issues, disparities, and whatnot. So I was able to study with her, and in one of our lessons, she asked me a question: "Can you picture yourself doing anything else in life? Can you see yourself doing anything else in life that could potentially be a financial outlet for you?" When thinking about that, I honestly can't imagine myself doing anything else that I would be happy doing while also making money off of. So that specific question really kind of helped me and guided me into choosing my career as a music performance major. Of course there were other small experiences, like just finding joy in actual performances and joy in performing with other people. But that question definitely was a huge guide in helping me make the decision.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Would that be just any sort of academic class or, like, could you clarify that a little bit?  

**I'll leave the definition up to you. Some people have talked about classes, some people have talked about extracurriculars, and the other music performance majors I've interviewed have talked a lot about music, so...**  

<laugh> Well, in that case, there's a lot of different things that have been memorable. I'd say one of the biggest memorable things that I've done was performing with my chamber ensemble. We formed recently and we've been pretty successful in what we've been able to accomplish, in terms of making a little bit of a name for ourselves throughout the school, making a name for ourselves outside of the school because of the competitions that we've competed in this past year...it's been a lot of fun! Especially because chamber music is a part of the requirements for a music performance degree. I'd say it's one of the most fun parts of the degree, because it doesn't feel like something that I have to do; it's something that I genuinely want to do and something that I enjoy doing. So just being with my chamber group and doing anything with them, from performing to the competitions that we've done, has been the most memorable so far.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

I'd say about seven to eight hours depending on the semester and depending on my availability.

**Is this including practice time and classwork?**  

Oh no, this was strictly just my work schedule!

**<laugh>. Okay. So an actual job?**

Yes. Okay, for work for school and stuff, I'd say...oh boy.  

**I've been asking people to include whatever they would consider work. Any time that's not rest, basically.**  

Oh man. That's pretty much the majority of my days then. I guess 12 hours? Well, 12 hours per day, which...what would that be every five-day week? I can't do math.

I would say 12 hours every five days, just generally.  

**Okay. What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester? When I say waking rest, I mean time that you're taking to relax during the day.** 

Maybe eight to 10 hours, I'd say. If that includes sleep then eight to 10 hours. If that doesn't include sleep, then maybe less than that.  

**Uh, eight to 10 per week including sleep?**  

Oh, no, sorry. Not per week. Per day, per day. <laugh> 

Yeah, if that includes sleep, then eight to 10 per week. Er, per day, per day, oh my gosh. I'm mixing up my words.  

**What about outside of sleep?**  

Outside of sleep? I'd say maybe two to three. This is a five day week. I'd say if we're talking a seven day week, then depending on the time of the year, it could easily go up to the entire day for Saturday and Sunday.  

**Okay, sure. Going back to work hours, would that change when factoring in weekends as well?**  

Well in terms of my actual job, I don't work on the weekends. But in terms of work that's not like paid work, I'd say on the weekends, maybe four to five hours. Okay, four to five hours on average across both days.  

**Okay.**  

**What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was? And again, this is including all work.**  

All work...So my busiest semester was either winter semester of my sophomore year or this past semester, winter semester of junior year. Probably this semester, honestly, now that I think about it. And the average amount of work...if we include both the work from my pay job and the work that I consider to be work outside of my job, maybe around eight to 10 hours per day, I'll say that.  

**Including weekends?**

Not including weekends. If we include weekends, then that could go up to, like, 13 to 15 hours.

**And for that semester, what is the average number of waking rest hours you week? So again, not including sleep.**  

I'd say per day, it was probably about an hour to two hours.  

**Okay. Again, just checking on weekends?**  

Weekends. Oh, I keep forgetting about the weekends! <laugh> The weekends would probably be pretty much the entire day minus that few four to five hours. Yeah, pretty much the entire day for the weekends, 'cause I would literally schedule time for me to do nothing or I go insane.  

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

In a single week...hold on, I have to do some quick math here if we're going by averages...113 hours.  

**Can you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Yeah. There was one week this past semester where I had, uh, <laugh> So I had on top of upcoming finals and stuff, studying for all of those, I had to practice for my upcoming jury. ["Jury" refers to a performance to a committee of music professors that determines whether a junior can continue on to complete their degree.] I had papers due, I had some senior recitals and master's degree recitals that I had agreed to play in that week - so the rehearsals for those took up extra time, 'cause you know, we had to rehearse the pieces that we were supposed to be playing on these people's recitals. Yeah, I'd say that that week specifically, it was basically wake up, do my morning classes or afternoon classes, practicing rehearsals for the senior / master's recitals, rehearsals with my chamber group, time where I actually had to practice for my juries - or for my jury, not juries, that'd be crazy. Um, and...oh my gosh. And then my actual job. <laugh> Also taking into account the work that I had to do for my actual job. So yeah, it was just a lot of stuff going on that week.  

It's all a blur at this point 'cause I just put it behind me. That's what I can remember from most of it.  

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I wouldn't say that I have much control, honestly. I'd say that generally I can start out with a decent amount of control if I plan ahead and have a little bit of discipline on myself, but usually when things get harder and usually as they go on for longer amounts of time, I have a harder time maintaining that. And I fall back into bad habits as a result.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yes. Mainly because you know, now I actually get to focus on music, whereas back in high school I had to focus on music along with focusing on all of the academic stuff like math, science, social studies and English classes that we were required to take. So even though it gets difficult and stressful at times, it's a little bit more of something that I wanna do and I'm usually more enthusiastic about it because it's something I actually want to do.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, I'd say I have way less energy now than I did when I was in high school. Generally, I'm more tired. Generally I'd say I'm also more stressed out, especially 'cause I'm holding myself to a much higher standard being at UofM than I did when I was in high school, just because of the stigma around UofM with, you know, everybody being incredibly smart, and in terms of the music school, being incredibly talented and all that stuff.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, I'd say generally I'm doing a lot better here than I was in high school, just 'cause in high school there was a lot I didn't care about. I didn't care that much about the non-music related stuff, and so I think my grades reflect a little bit better now that I'm doing mainly music stuff. Of course in my non-music related classes, I am holding myself to a higher standard and trying to do well in those classes just 'cause I want to be proud of myself and proud of how I do while at this school. And generally, I've been pretty happy with the results so far.  

**Okay. Shifting gears for a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

I'd say I try to keep things pretty realistic in terms of my goals. Just because in this day and age, in this *economy*, there's a lot that is accessible for me personally, while at the same time there's a lot of stuff that isn't accessible or isn't possible. Or just isn't worth my time for this said goal or whatever.  

I'd say in terms of accomplishing them, I'm pretty consistent. Because usually when I set a goal, it's usually a long term goal. If I'm giving a very recent example, the fellowship that I just came from actually has been a long term goal of mine. I auditioned for this fellowship as a freshman and was rejected, and then I auditioned again this past year and was accepted. So that was like one of the big goals, but I set a bunch of small little goals along this journey in order to be able to obtain the big goal. Of course, how I'm practicing, making little goals within my actual practice sessions to ensure that I'm being consistent there so that it can actually reflect in my playing...yeah. I'd say generally, as long as I plan everything out accordingly and I'm consistent with the smaller goals that I set for myself, usually I can reach the bigger goals.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Technically yes. On my academic record, yes I was. But personally, no, I felt like I only really excelled again in music areas in my life.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Yeah, just 'cause there's a lot that ends up on my plate throughout each semester, and I feel like a lot of the times I have to hold myself to a high standard in order to be able to stay up to the tasks that I'm given. Yeah.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

We're pretty close! <laugh> I've definitely had my fair share of failures throughout my whole life, honestly. Both if we're talking academic failures - not that I've ever failed a class or anything, but I've definitely had my fair share of academic failures where I may have not done very great on an assignment or even exams. In terms of more personal failures, I've definitely have had moments where I didn't do well on something that I personally was trying to accomplish.  

I'd say there was a good while where I had a fear of failure, and I'd say that fear has decreased a little bit over time, because I do think - and I've been told this by multiple people - but I do think that for the career path that I'm going on, failure is something that is bound to happen. And that's important to happen because it teaches you things that you wouldn't necessarily learn if you were constantly back-to-back-to-back successful in everything. It also keeps you humble. <laugh> Yeah, I'd say failure and I are pretty familiar with each other though.   

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I usually feel pretty good, especially if it's something that I feel like I earned. That's pretty much that.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Very good ones, of course. I feel like all of the work that I put into whatever goal it is that I succeeded in was all worth it. I feel proud of myself and excited about whatever it is that I may have accomplished.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

Generally, I think most people are also excited for me. Sometimes I've come across people who may act as if they're excited, but it's very obvious that they deep down may not necessarily be happy or might even have a little bit of jealousy, depending on the situation. Coming from my own personal experience of having felt similar feelings, it can kind of be easy to recognize that same kind of feeling in other people at times.

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Burnout - yes.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

To me, burnout is when the drive to do what you are passionate about doing, or just the drive to in general, go throughout life - whatever life may be, depending on the person. Um, it just gets incredibly exhausting, and you may feel more tired physically. You may not have the energy to put in a lot of effort into a lot of different areas of your life. I know that's how burnout personally feels for me and how it shows itself in me - it just gets exhausting to do literally anything.

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**

Mm-hmm.

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

To me, imposter syndrome is the feeling of accomplishing something and then not feeling like it's deserved. Even if you put in all of the work, even if other people have expressed excitement or good feelings, good emotions towards your accomplishment, you yourself don't feel like you've earned it. You feel like you're an imposter in the situation and that if somebody may find you out, they'll say "Oh yeah, this person didn't actually deserve this" or whatever it may be.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah, literally just did from this fellowship.  

**Could you describe some of your experiences at burnout?**  

Well, with this fellowship specifically, towards the end of it, it was getting very, very exhausting because they were demanding a lot. They were demanding a lot out of us, and it was getting to a point where I was having a hard time just finding the energy to wake up and go to our rehearsals every day. There'd be times where I was this close to not going to a rehearsal, or this close to skipping a required masterclass or something. In terms of this past semester of school, I'd say burnout would show up in the forms of me just straight up skipping class. There'd be times when I would skip class for the entire week. <laugh> Which I can't say that I'm proud of, but in the moment I was incredibly exhausted. It just...I would've gone to class and I wouldn't have been able to pay attention anyway, 'cause I would've been so exhausted and just mentally not there. There have been performances where mentally, I wasn't there. Maybe my fingers were doing all of the work, but mentally I may have been somewhere else, or maybe I was thinking, "I want to go home" or "I'm tired", "I'm hungry". All of that stuff.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah, multiple times. I'd say this fellowship - I keep bringing it up - but I definitely felt a sense of imposter syndrome, especially the closer and closer it got to the date where I was supposed to leave for the fellowship. Because I was paranoid that the people there would hear me and then wonder why I was there or how I got into this festival.

That's just a very recent example. But generally, I've had many moments where I've definitely achieved something, and maybe in the moment I was very excited and very happy and proud of myself. But usually, as the date for the arrival of this event or fellowship or program or whatever would get closer, I would more and more be thinking, "I don't think I want this anymore. Don't think I wanna go anymore. 'cause people are gonna hear me and question why I'm there."  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

It's incredibly prevalent. Most of my friends...it's a very common thing for a lot of my friends and a lot of my peers to constantly say things like "I'm tired, I don't feel like doing this anymore, I want to go home, this, this and this, this, this and that". I'd say it's very common.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

Also very common amongst my peers. You know, being in the music world, in the music school, it can definitely get to a point where it can be a little overwhelming as you see more people in the school doing really great things. Maybe you're wondering for yourself, "Why am I not accomplishing as much as this person is?" Especially if the person is in the same studio as you, or even within the same department, but maybe they just play a different instrument or they're a different voice range, you know, different music-related fields or whatever. But I'd say it's pretty common amongst my peers, especially in music school.  


**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Well in terms of burnout, I'd say COVID had a bigger impact on that in terms of my awareness of it, more than imposter syndrome did, because I think I've dealt with imposter syndrome even before COVID was what it is today. But for burnout, I think before the pandemic happened, I kind of was just in a hyper-drive of things. I think I had more energy generally, and if I was having moments of feeling exhausted or tired or just having no energy to do things, I probably just...I wouldn't necessarily label it as burnout, but I think after this pandemic, it definitely is something that I think is not only more common for myself, but also more common that I - I see for literally everyone in the entire world, and especially people in our generation, like college people or people who are in school in general.  

Definitely more aware of it now just 'cause people are also more vocal about it too. Now that I think about it, I've noticed on social media, people will joke about burnout, which is probably like a coping mechanism of some sort. <laugh> And you'll definitely see this a lot around finals and midterm season, where people on social media will make posts or make videos and stuff about burnout, but they won't specifically call it burnout. They'll just be like, "Oh, midterm season, stressful, yada yada" trying to make humor out of it, I suppose. Definitely something that I think I see a lot more of now, or rather seeing a lot more of it. But like you said, I think I'm more aware of it in people now because of the pandemic, 'cause just people are more vocal about it.  

**Close to wrapping up: considering everything that we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yeah, I do. It can be stressful, but I definitely find enjoyment in it. Otherwise I wouldn't still be doing it! <laugh>  

**Basically the same question, but do you also enjoy your musical work as well?**  

Oh yeah. That's the highlight of what I feel like my entire life is around. If that's my whole personality trait, then yeah, it is, 'cause I love music. I love everything about it. I think it's...I think it's great.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I was definitely more aware of imposter syndrome than I was of burnout. I guess in a sense I was aware of burnout, but I wasn't aware of the official term for it or what exactly encompasses burnout.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I'd probably tell myself to surround myself with people who are like-minded and who will act as a support system. Especially in times of need, I tell myself to focus on the end goals that I set for myself and to not let other people's goals and accomplishments influence how I feel like I'm worth. Yeah. I would just tell myself to focus on what I came here to do, of course staying open to other possibilities of whatever the music world has to offer. But ultimately staying focused on the end goal.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Um, I think that is about it. I think, just...  

Imposter syndrome and burnout are very, very real issues. So for anyone who may see this in the future, it is very real, and your emotions and feelings are very valid. But don't let imposter syndrome and burnout deter you from the goals that you set for yourself. Know that it is a very seasonal issue and that you are capable of accomplishing what you want to accomplish so long as you are surrounding yourself with like-minded people who care about you and who will uplift you. Yeah, that's the most important thing, surrounding yourself with good people and staying focused on your goals.  

**All right. If that's that, then I'll go ahead and end the interview here.**
