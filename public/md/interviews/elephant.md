**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

So prior to coming to UofM, I went to high school, and I kind of just did what everyone normally does. Elementary, middle, and high school.  

**Okay. Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I don't think I have a specific number for how many I would count as my peers, but mostly just anyone in my classes or anyone I work with on a side project. I consider them my peers.  

**Do you have any numerical estimate on that?**

I would say like 20 people accumulated throughout the four years.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your major for undergrad?**  

I did three and a half years.  

**Okay. What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

So I was actually never a huge fan of math, but I kind of just got pushed towards it by my parents. And then I actually ended up liking math, and then they signed me up for a computer science camp when I was in eighth grade. It was an all-girls computer science camp, and I guess just being in that camp and actually being introduced to programming for the first time really got me excited about it and just made me feel, "Okay, I feel like this is the path that I wanna take in college". Then I took a couple of high school classes too, like AP computer science, and my teacher introduced me to a lot of clubs involving computer science and opportunities for girls within this major. Doing all of this got me really excited, and that's why I did computer science for my undergrad.  

**OK. Do you mind also sharing your choice for graduate major?**  

Yeah. So along with computer science - it was between computer science and data science for a long time for my undergrad major. I know there is an option to double major in it, but I just felt like that wasn't really for me in some ways. So that's why in undergrad I decided I would just minor in applied statistics so I can get that statistical knowledge and do a grad degree in applied data science. And I'm doing applied data science and not just data science, because I do have that computer science background. By doing the more applied version of this major, I'll be able to still do programming while taking a lot more statistics classes.  

**Okay. What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Does it have to be academics, or could it be research projects and everything?  

**Whatever you count as academics, but I would say research falls under that.**  

I'm trying to think...I honestly think, like when doing the research project, it was being offered to be a lead for the team. I think that was honestly one of the most memorable moments throughout my undergrad, because just getting that opportunity for that specific team kind of motivated me to see a different aspect of what I can do. I thought that after college, I would just stick with programming and never move up to management or managing a team. But just getting that opportunity kind of encouraged me to - even though I am pursuing a master's in the fall, I do wanna go for an MBA a couple years down the line just to get into more management. But I feel like that moment when I actually was able to get that kind of motivated me somehow to see a different aspect of myself.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

I would say about like, 60 to 70 hours a week.

**And what was your average amount of rest hours?**  

I would say per night, I would get four to five hours of sleep; and honestly, some nights I wouldn't sleep, which wasn't great. But yeah, it would just be minimal rest.  

**What about waking rest hours?**  

Oh. I don't know, maybe three to four hours a day? I would try to keep at least three hours as resting.  

**Is it safe to say 21 to 28 hours per week then?**  

Yeah, I would say that.  

**Okay. What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**

...honestly, it was the same. I felt like every semester was the same level of difficulty.  

**Okay. So then same for rest hours then as well?**  

Yeah, same for rest hours and everything.  

**Okay. What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

Um, I can think of one week that was really bad. I think it was finals week, and I worked I thinkâ€¦honestly, like 12 hours a day when I was studying for finals. So I think 12 times 7, that much. But I mean, it wasn't really much more than I was used to working.

**Okay. How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

In the first couple of semesters of college, I felt like I had hardly any control over how I spent my time, because I felt like I was really overloaded with work. But as the years went on, I tried to have a bit more of a set schedule. Even though I was working a lot more, I still let myself rest in my resting hours. I wouldn't just be thinking about work, it would just be resting. So I guess over time I kind of got better at time management and managing my mental health too.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

I think my junior year, especially when COVID hit, I feel like my enthusiasm went down a lot. Because it was constantly being at home and just studying all the time, and I was like, "I just wanna finish this. I don't even wanna be here at this point. Why am I even majoring in this? It's so time-consuming." But I guess once I actually found a way to get past that initial, uh, COVID and lack of motivation, I felt a lot better. So second semester junior year.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, definitely. I think in the beginning, I was definitely a lot more energized. Even though I was overloaded with work, I wasn't really overwhelmed; but halfway through, I felt overwhelmed almost like every day. But then at the end - I don't know why - my energy kind of spiked back up, and I was ready and excited to finish.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, in the beginning I definitely struggled a lot. I would be in the lower half, and it was hard for me, especially my first class and even failing an exam. It wasn't great, but I think as the years went on, I think I improved a lot more.  

**Okay, shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Um, some of the goals I set for myself are very realistic. They're mostly just long term in some ways, like "I want this degree", "I wanna do well in this class", or even short-term where it's like, "I wanna get this GPA at the end of the semester". But I know for myself, I do set a bit of unrealistic long-term goals where I wanna achieve something great. But I know it's gonna take years of work to actually get there, and sometimes I don't even end up achieving it.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

I would say I was in between average and a really good student. So I wouldn't say I was the best, but I would say I was just above average.  

**Do you care to elaborate?**  

Yeah. So my high school had a lot of high achieving people. I wouldn't say I was in the top 5% where I was just acing everything, getting like, hundreds on tests. I would be in the range of getting an 85 to a 95 on a test. So I wouldn't say I was average, where I got Cs, but I would say like I got mostly As and a couple Bs. So I guess that's a little above average, but not exactly average.

**Do you or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Um, it depends. It depends on the people you actually associate yourself with, because I know some people who are okay with being average, and they kind of just take it easy while they're studying, but still get good grades. But then there's some people who just over-the-top achieve, and then sometimes you do feel that kind of pressure. You're like, "We're at the same school, why don't I try to like, achieve as much as they're achieving when we're studying the same things?" I think I felt it once or twice, trying to be a superhuman and thinking "I wanna do as well as this person". I thought it was motivating myself, but sometimes it's just better to work at your own pace and do what you can do and not try to be someone else. 

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

Honestly, I have failed many, many times in my life. Not even at UofM, but also before UofM, 'cause I grew up in a school district that was over-the-top achieving. So if I didn't achieve those grades, I would kind of think of myself as a failure, which isn't a great mindset for someone who's 12 years old. That kind of motivated me to do better. Even at UofM, I think I have definitely failed exams and assignments, and it could sometimes be because of my procrastination or sometimes because I wasn't understanding the class and I knew I needed extra help. So I have failed, and I've even failed job interviews too. So I feel like I failed every step of the way in order to actually achieve what I have right now.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I feel happy about it because it means that from that initial failure, I actually did something good and I actually motivated myself and was able to accomplish something even with that initial failure. So it makes me feel a bit satisfied in what I've done.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Just a feeling of satisfaction, but then also the fact that I know I have a lot more to do and a lot further to go. So it's just an initial step until something else that I wanna achieve.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I've met both types of people, where I have some people who are mad about it or jealous with it, and I've met people who really stand by you when you're successful. And I mean, seeing the difference in people, I try to move away from the people that are jealous of it and stay with the people that are actually satisfied with it.  

Okay.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah, briefly.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

I think burnout is pushing yourself more than you think you can do something. I guess saying it in a way: if I constantly keep pushing myself to do something where I feel someone else has achieved it easier than me, but continuously pushing myself until I get to the point where I just can't really do anything anymore.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yeah, I have.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Um, it's mostly just feeling as an imposter, kind of as an alien in a situation.  

**Okay. Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah, I think a couple times, whether it be academically or personally; I have experienced it in both ways. And I know when I'm getting to the point of burnout since I've had it badly in both kinds of situations. So I try to avoid it now.

**Could you describe some of your experiences with burnout?**  

Yeah, so I would say academically, it was when...I think we were talking about before, like trying to be someone else and achieving what they have. So I know when I started at UofM, I saw a lot of smart people, and I would always try my hardest to be like them and strive, even though I know my mental capacity or my potential might not be as much as their potential is - but it might be just different in its own way, like I could achieve something in a different way than someone else could. So I feel like that comparison, that constant comparison to other people academically, caused a little bit of that burnout, to overachieve when I knew I shouldn't have in that way and I should have just taken my own time to achieve that. And personally, it was always just giving people the benefit of the doubt and constantly taking on other people's stress, and then stressing myself out to the point where I couldn't mentally handle it and I burnt out.  

**Okay. Do you believe you ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

I think only when I actually started at UofM, when I didn't really know many people and just started off. It kind of relates to burnout where I was trying to be like other people, but also starting off and feeling like you're not good enough to be in this class. Yeah. I did feel that at times, but as you get through college, you also mature mentally. So you get over that initial feeling of trying to be like someone else, and I feel like imposter syndrome also decreases.

**Could you elaborate a bit more about how you experienced less imposter syndrome as you developed more as a student and a person?**  

Yeah, I think it's more when you're starting off. Especially when you're just starting off your major, you find a lot of people who have probably been programming for like, 10 years before college. They already know all the answers, and you're just sitting there like, "Oh my god, I don't know anything. I might not just be as smart as these people." So you feel like you're not as smart, and you're kind of on the outside in some ways? And you don't belong in that particular class. So I guess the hardest thing is comparing yourself to people, 'cause I felt like that a lot in college where I would constantly compare myself. But as you grow throughout college, you realize there's no point in comparing yourself to other people, because you're gonna do your own thing and they're gonna do their own thing. It doesn't really matter. So I guess mentally maturing really helps decrease imposter syndrome, because when you go to a class, just because someone's "smarter" than you doesn't mean that you're not as smart as them.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I think it's pretty common. It honestly depends on a person's mentality too, because a lot of my friends who can easily glide through classes hardly burn out, because they don't need to work as hard. There's the other end of the spectrum too, where there's a lot of people who just don't really care as much and just wanna pass with a C or something. They also don't get burnt out, because they're not doing as much effort. But then there's the people in the middle where I kind of associate myself with, and I notice those people burn out very easily where they feel the pressure of getting internships and getting good grades in classes and not feeling like they're good enough compared to their peers. So there's that middle group of people that I've known who feel like we're not good enough as the people who can easily glide through, but we also don't wanna be lazy and just get a C in a class.  

**Sure. How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?** 

Personally? I've never really asked anyone if they do feel imposter syndrome, I just know I've experienced it and I'm sure there's a couple people who have also experienced it too - again, the same group of people that kind of say, "We don't know this stuff, but we do still wanna learn this because we really like it, but we're just not as smart as these people".  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

I think COVID has made it a little bit better in some ways, just because you're not in a class full of people - like in person, where you feel like you have to constantly compare yourself. But at the same time, you are still in a Zoom class with them and you do have those people who voluntarily like, ask questions, but it's less common when you're on a Zoom call than when you're in person. So it again factors into that, like, comparing yourself to another person. But with COVID you're alone constantly, so if you burn out, it's because you're pushing yourself too hard. It isn't because you're comparing yourself to anyone else.  

**Close to wrapping up here, just a few more questions and we'll be done. Considering everything we've talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work at UofM?**  

I really did. Besides being burnt out at times and feeling like an imposter at the beginning, I definitely really liked all of UofM's classes. Even though it was hard for me at first, it really motivated me. And after taking a class, I felt like I learned so much, and it's been helping me with internships and even jobs now. So I mean, I really enjoyed it overall.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Not super conscious about burnout, but I was pretty familiar with imposter syndrome, especially going to a high school with high-achieving people. You do feel like an imposter sometimes when you're kind of the average person in an AP class.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

would just tell myself don't try to be like someone else. Don't compare yourself to other people, because the more you do, the harder it becomes for you to focus on what you wanna achieve in life, because everyone has their own path. The more you compare yourself to another person, the more you're just making yourself feel bad. It isn't even a way of motivation - you should just be yourself, be who you are, and no matter what you do, just accept it and move on from there. 

**Is there anything else you'd like to say?**  

Not that I can think of.  

**Alright, thank you for your time. This will conclude the interview and I'll stop recording here.**
