**Alright, as a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

So I went to high school in Michigan., I would say we were provided with a lot of opportunities there. I think it was very general education, but when I had electives to take, I enjoyed taking business-type classes, and I also really enjoyed history classes.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Um, I would say maybe like 25. Do you want me to elaborate on what it means to me?

**That'd be good, yeah.**  

Okay, so from that I'm including all six of my housemates, and then also the 10 people on my sports team, which I feel like I hang out with regularly outside of practice. Then the other nine or 10 comes from my neighbors and other friends that I'm friends with at school, through clubs or just through social circles that I hang out with or contact on a weekly basis.  

**Okay. How many years have you been in your major?**  

So I applied my sophomore year - it's a two year program. So this year was my first year within the major or taking major specific classes.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Um, so I had applied to Ross, at high school and I really thought I was for sure gonna do something like that. And I didn't get in and I was really heartbroken, but I still really wanted to go to Michigan. So I decided to go through LSA, which I originally got into, and I didn't really know at the time what I wanted to major in. I decided to just take the first year, take classes that interest me, and I could kind of figure it out from then. I thought I could maybe go back and apply to Ross again, but you can't apply after you already didn't get in. So I decided "Okay, maybe I'll minor in it and then maybe major in econ", but I didn't love econ enough to major in it. 

Then just talking to my advisor about my interests and stuff, he kind of told me about the program I'm in right now, and then I kind of talked to other people in the program, found out that I thought it would be a good fit. It was really interdisciplinary, very liberal arts approach, it was very flexible. You can kind of decide kind of what path you wanted to take in the major - so if I wanted to take some econ classes I could, but it didn't have to be fully econ classes; I could also add in some psychology or sociology classes. Just finding that out made me think that would be a good fit for me, so I ended up applying and got into the program the end of my sophomore year.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM? Whatever you would consider academics.**

Yeah, okay. Um, I think a group project I worked on within one of my classes: it was a group of me and two other guys in my major. Honestly, before this, because my program has less than 100 people in it per grade, I expected to become pretty close with the people in it. But after my first semester, there wasn't a ton of people that I felt like I was super close with. But then when I was doing this group project for my classes, I felt like I really connected with other people in my group. And I think it was an interesting project that we worked on; it was about a company's expansion into foreign markets and how their operations work there. So I just thought it was an interesting topic, and I enjoyed the team.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester, whatever you would consider work?**  

Well, I don't have a paid job, but work...I guess schoolwork, I would say outside of classes I maybe spend 10 hours a week on outside work for classes. I don't know if...maybe that's right. Yeah, that's probably about right.  

**And for an average week and average semester, what was the number of waking rest hours that you got? So time taken off during the day.**

Maybe 10 hours a week just relaxing. Like sitting, talking with my roommates and stuff like in the kitchen, I guess I consider that time off relaxing. Or eating. It's probably more than 10 hours actually; it's probably more like 15. 16.  

**As a student athlete, how much time do you spend on your sport per week?**  

So we have practice in the mornings and afternoons six days a week. I would say morning practice is typically two hours, afternoon practices are like three hours. So five hours a day, so 30 hours a week.  

**Okay. What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Um, probably this past fall. If I'm counting work as every time I'm not relaxing or when I'm not sleeping, like either school, sport, or homework, I would say that was like 15 hours a day...no, 14 hours a day. I dunno.

**Okay. And then for that semester, what would be your average number of rest hours per week?**  

Um, probably around the same? I just didn't sleep as much, probably. Like two hours a day.

**Okay. What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

I really don't know. I'd probably be making up a number, but maybe, um, uh, I really don't know. 70 hours? I don't really have a good answer to that question. I can't of a week where I was like, "Oh my gosh, that was the busiest week ever", and I don't really know if I can quantify how many hours it was.

**Hmm.**  

**Well, even if you can't think of one specific week, can you walk me through an example of a particularly busy week?**  

Yeah, sure. I guess I'll walk through a typical week in the fall. So Monday was our off day for sport, but I wake up at 7:30 for class. I had class at 8:30, so I eat breakfast really quick, probably finish up a little bit of homework before class, walk to class. Class was from 8:30 to 10, then I had another class 10:00 to 11:30, then I'd walk home after that, eat a little lunch, do homework, usually join office hours around that time, like maybe around one. And then I pretty much did homework up until a class I had that was 5:30 to 8:30. Uh, maybe eat a little bit of a snack before going to class, then come home from class, maybe eat dinner, then finish up some homework, maybe hang out for like an hour, then go to bed.

And then Tuesday I'll wake up at 5:00, grab something really quick for breakfast - not really sit down and eat - then drive to practice. And I'd get back from practice at 8:00-ish, and then I'd have time to take a quick nap, maybe for 20 or 30 minutes, maybe up to an hour. Then I would do a little bit of homework, and then my next class started at 10. Have class from 10 to 11:30, and then I think I had another class from then. I guess I would come home after that, eat a little lunch, and I'd have class 1:00 to 2:30 and then I had to get ready for practice and go to the bus. The bus takes 20 minutes to get to our practice location, and then we'd be out there from like, 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Then I'd get back to campus at 7:30, maybe have a club meeting from 8:00 to 9:00, then come home, eat dinner if I didn't before, take a shower, do homework for maybe an hour or two depending on how much I had. Maybe if I didn't have too much homework, I would just spend an hour downstairs hanging out with my roommates, then I would go to bed. 

And then pretty much that Tuesday is the same as Thursday. Monday is the same as Wednesday, but just add practice to Wednesday. And Friday I would have practice in the morning and afternoon, but I wouldn't have class. I would maybe have office hours or meetings during the day. And then Saturday, same thing, just practices, but no class. And then maybe some football games, social fun things. And then Sunday practice, but no class. Does that make sense?  

**Yep. That's good.** 

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I feel like I have a good amount of control, but once I make commitments, you kind of lose some of that. So I guess with like, those five hours a day that we have practice, I don't really have any control on changing those or getting back from practice earlier. I just don't have control on that. So that means missing other commitments, but I mean, it is ultimately my decision to do that. So I feel like I do have a lot of control, but once I make commitments, I give away some of that.    

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Mmm, no, I don't...maybe a little bit. Just because in some ways when I saw myself struggling in classes or getting grades, like bad grades or grades I've never gotten before, that kind of hurt a little bit and made me lose some enthusiasm. So I guess, yes. Yeah.

But it's kind of counteracted because there's so many more classes to take and so many different interests of mine. So I feel like my exploration needs are being met, but sometimes I feel like I'm failing.

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, yeah. I mean, it actually depends on the week. Some weeks I'll be so exhausted, so tired, but then other weeks I'll feel like I have a lot of energy just 'cause I'm surrounded by so many good people and good friends. And I'm excited to do all these fun things, but also I'm just so busy, kind of exhausted too. So I would say it's just more of both sides of the spectrum. In high school, it was more like riding a smoother wave. Now it's more ups and downs.  

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

In my opinion - there's definitely been some more, like, blimps or little sore spots where I'm like, "Ooh, that grade's not great", but honestly, overall my grades have been pretty consistent and pretty good overall. But there's just a few things where I wish I could go back and change that or something; but it's more rare than I feel like it occupies space in my mind.

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Um, I would say I'm not the type of goal setter who writes my goals down, and maybe I should be more like that. But I kind of just have expectations for myself in my head.

I would say overall, pretty realistic. The only goal I can think of that I specifically wrote down and thought out and didn't achieve was a goal in my sport; but also it was because I had an injury. So I guess you just don't plan for those things sometimes. But yeah, I don't really write out a lot of goals. I kind of just have these thoughts in my head and try to make them work as best as I can.  

**Okay. In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

I mean for high school, I did well, but I wasn't like a nationally recognized student. But I guess I did...did well, I guess, in high school.

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

I feel like sometimes...I guess I just mainly get these frustrations from, like, my coaches. I just think they don't understand that we have all these commitments outside of sport too. We're not just athletes, we're also students too. That's what I originally went to school for.

And I'm like, "How do they expect us to hold these good grades at school, and to have a good team GPA and also spend time exploring what careers you wanna take after college too, if they don't really respect our time?" Like sometimes practice just doesn't end when they say it will  

**Out of curiosity, does it ever go the other way as well? With class professors not respecting your time as an athlete?**  

I've never had a professor that wasn't understanding of me missing a day because of my sport or something, or me being late to something, or maybe I couldn't go to office hours. Most professors are really, like...I've needed to go to office hours before and they're like, "Okay, let's set up a time. We can meet for office hours a different time." So honestly they've been pretty understanding. I mean, I don't expect them to give me opportunities that other students don't have just because I may have a lot of other commitments outside of classes. So I think they've been pretty flexible and wanna help and understand that I have things on the weekends and practices that mean I miss office hours or have to miss a class on Friday or something.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

I would say I...kind of redefined failure since being at college. And I think I thought of it differently in high school. Like in high school, I would probably think of getting a B on a little quiz  that didn't really matter as a failure. But I think now, I just don't think of it the same way and like really nothing's, like - I can't honestly think of an instance in my life where I've felt, "Oh my goodness, that was a failure". Because I feel like I have learned from everything in some way, or something? A failure would just be if I gave up on life, that's the only thing I could think of that's a failure. Everything else you learn from and you move forward. Nothing stops you in your track so much that I'd consider a failure, or I mean from things that I've encountered so far.

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Um, I would say...I do appreciate it. I do like to be recognized and receive praise for doing well, but also sometimes it could be a little bit uncomfortable and awkward. Like I feel like if someone praises me for academics, I kind of laugh at that, that kind of embarrassed laugh, like, "Oh, haha, thanks". But also I think praise, whether it's in academics or any other aspect of my life, I think is really beneficial for me and makes me want to keep working harder and stuff. So I think I appreciate it.

**Mm-hmm.**

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

I would say when I succeed, I feel like I can give more to others. 'cause I feel satisfied in my life, and then I feel like I can move forward and invest more in other relationships, which ultimately makes me happier all around. But it's a lot easier for me to invest in those relationships when I feel like I've made a positive step forward in my life or succeeded in something.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I think my friends, like my closest friends are really happy and excited for me when I succeed. But then I can think of other people in my life, maybe some friends that I've distanced myself from, who are maybe jealous or don't like...yeah, I guess jealous, and just don't seem like they care as much and stuff. But I think that people who can truly be happy for you when you succeed are true friends.

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**

Yeah, I feel like I've heard it more recently. And in terms of sports and athletics, yeah.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

I think it's when you have been doing one thing for so long and focus so much of your energy and efforts towards that, and you feel like you're not getting what you should receive in return from it, whether that's praise or progress, recognition, enjoyment. So then you have burnout.

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Uh, yes, I've heard it. I feel like I've only heard it in the past two years, honestly, or a year maybe.  

**How would you define imposter syndrome in your own words?**  

You feel like you don't belong somewhere even though you've definitely taken the necessary steps and deserve that place where you are. Or maybe you got into a school - you definitely made it, but it still just doesn't feel like the right fit and you feel out of place.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Um, yeah. I feel like I have recently experienced it with my sport in the past, uh, six months or so.

**Could you elaborate?**  

Yeah. Around spring break, I kind of just hit a point where I felt like I was giving more to the team than I was receiving in return. And I also had some injuries and stuff, and I just felt like the coaches didn't quite understand and adjust the training plan accordingly. Because a lot of people on the team were facing the same injuries, just from overuse and stuff like that. And also, the same problems year after year are brought to the coaches, and nothing gets changed. And also I think this year, having a bunch of good friends who are not on the team too, I see all the things that they're doing.  

So during spring break, they got to go to Hawaii, go on vacation. And during the week they just have a lot more free time to do other things. I think I just saw like all the things I could be doing, and I was instead doing something where I felt like I was just hurting my body more, like I wasn't enjoying going to practice. It wasn't fun for me anymore, and I was just ready to do something new at the time. I thought I was gonna quit right then and there, but I decided I had to finish out the season and then just reevaluate from there.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Um, I think so. I've never really called it that before or said that; I was just always like, "Oh, I just don't feel confident in this space anymore. Everyone's just smarter than me, everyone's stronger than me." Whatever it is. I would say just putting myself in a new situation, I often feel that way; but I've always told myself, "I'm just lacking confidence right now". That's how I always thought of it in the past.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

Ooh. I would say around the people I surround myself with, especially a lot of my teammates, it's very common. But a lot of people feel the same feelings from talking to my friends on the team.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

I also feel like it's pretty common. Especially when we're kind of entering the stage of, I don't know - we're trying to figure out what our careers wanna be like after this and internships and jobs. I feel like a lot of feelings are shared, like, "I just don't feel like I belong here. All these people are so proficient and like, they know...I just feel like I don't belong in this space". I feel like it's very common, especially among - I think among everyone, but especially among females. But I'm sure males too, I just don't talk to them about it.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Ooh. Yeah. Um, I...I just feel like during COVID times and virtual times, it was a lot harder to make connections. So it was a lot easier to feel imposter syndrome, because it was maybe harder to get to know people. I believe that once you get to know people, whether that's in your workplace or at school, you can overcome those feelings; but when you first enter a space and people seem so much smarter than you - like all these things and the perception that they let off - when you get to know them, people are so much more down to earth than that. And during COVID, it was harder to cross that barrier and get to know people past what they were letting off. And so I think it just escalated it and intensified imposter syndrome. 

Burnout too, because there was less variation. It felt sometimes like a lot of things felt a little mundane, and everything was scaled back to fit a virtual environment or a COVID-safe environment. So I think it's easier to face burnout in that sense.  

**Okay. Close to wrapping up here: considering everything that we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Um, I do. I do really enjoy my academic work. I think sometimes - I feel like maybe this is the imposter syndrome coming in - I don't know if...I feel like I'm not gaining some technical skills or skills that maybe people in Ross are gaining. And I want to go into the same fields as them. I'm gonna be competing with them for jobs, whether that's in consulting and, um, probably consulting. But I'm just like, I'm like...I feel like I maybe don't have the same knowledge set as they do, that these firms are looking for.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Uh, I don't think I ever thought about the terms before coming to UofM.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I would tell myself that there's really no right or wrong path, and instead of spending your time trying to figure out what other people are doing or how you can meet them where they're at and, uh, catch up in a sense - it's not worth spending your time trying to do that. Instead, take that time to invest in yourself and find out about what makes you unique and different. Because I think in the long run, that's what really matters: being an interesting, different person who has unique interests or hobbies or skills will take you farther than trying to gain 90% of the skills that someone else has and be just like someone else, because you think that you wanna do what they do.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say?**  

Um, advice for myself...so that last piece of advice was more for imposter syndrome. In terms of burnout, I just think there's no harm in...like I think a lot of people are scared to quit things that they make commitments to, but I really don't think - like quitting is not failure. Especially if you're using that energy to explore something different. So let's say if I decide to stop my sport, or quit my sport. That's not considered failure. And I think there's so many other things out there, and if I wanted to dedicate my time to other things, like maybe a different sport or something, then there's totally that opportunity to do that. And I think for other things that I've done...I didn't realize coming into Michigan that I can just turn the tables at any moment. Because Michigan has so many opportunities and other things to explore.  

**Mm-hmm. That wraps up the interview, I'll stop recording there.**
