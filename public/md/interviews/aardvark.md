**So as a warm up, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

I went to the same school from kindergarten to 12th grade, all grades all in one building. So that was a bit different from most people, fairly small class size. I think my graduating class was 70-ish people. Um, I'm not sure about more you want than that. I mean, I was always one of the best people in the school. Like I had a 4.0 GPA, did pretty well on the SAT, that sort of stuff. Anything else you want?

**Whatever you feel is appropriate.**  

I feel like that was decent.

**Okay. Approximately how many people did you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I don't know. I guess I'd probably consider peers...same graduating class, same major? as, I don't know. I guess I'd probably consider it that. What else did you ask?  

**Um, approximately how many would you count as peers?**  

Oh, man, I have no idea. Probably a fairly large amount. Probably a couple hundred, I would guess? I don't know.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your major?**  

Years? Three. I did seven semesters, but one of them was a summer semester, so I got done early in that way.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Basically, ever since I can remember, I've wanted to do something with computers. So kind of an obvious choice from there to go into computer science. I picked computer science over computer engineering or electrical engineering because I was more interested in the software side of things than hardware or anything like that. But yeah, it's basically always been my preference since like elementary school.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Uh, definitely my first calculus three exam, I got a 35%! <laugh> Which was hands down the lowest grade I got ever, college or high school or anywhere. It was curved pretty well, so I was still barely able to pass. But that was definitely an eye opener: "Oh my goodness, I need to pay attention, I need to study more, I need to be better". <laugh> That was my first semester of college, because I got AP credit for calc one and two.

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

Like actual work? Not homework?  

**Whatever you would consider work - I think for most students, it's their coursework, class time, and other things that they would not consider relaxation.**  

Okay. So between actual work and school stuff, classes were probably...actually attending classes I think was somewhere around 20 to 25 hours a week, maybe another 10 or 15 for homework-type stuff and an extra 10 to 15 for actual work. So let's say 50, 55-ish.  

**Alright. And then what is the average number of rest hours you got per week in an average semester?**

If you consider rest hours just having fun or something like that, then I probably did...let's see, 15 to 20. Somewhere around there. Maybe 20 or 25.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**

I don't think any of my semesters were super busy or super light, so it's probably just - I said I think 50 to 55 before, it's probably just 55, 60, maybe 65. I don't think my semesters varied significantly.  

**What is the average number of rest hours you got per week in that busiest semester?**  

Probably take off 5 or 10 off whatever I said before. I said 15 to 20, so let's say 10 to 15 or something like that? Probably.  

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

Oh boy. I know there's one week I actually got overtime pay, so it's probably that week. That was partially a screw-up on their part - but let's say I worked 34 hours plus whatever schoolwork I did, which was at least attending classes. That's 34...that's 54 plus homework. Let's say like 65 to 70 for my busiest week.  

**Can you walk me through that week?**  

I think it was somewhat towards the end of the semester, getting close to exam time. I had two jobs. One was working as tech support for Student Life Technology Solutions. That was about 10 hours, I think, for a standard week. I was also working extra at the dining hall - I think as that was the semester I was in training to become a student coordinator, get a pay bump, whatever that entails. So I think that was partially the reason, I had to do a couple extra shifts there to fulfill my training before next semester started. As far as classes go, I think that was probably pretty standard, unless I had some project going on right before exams. I can't remember. I think that's about it, yeah.  

**How much control did you feel you had over how you spent your time?**  

That varied a little bit, especially with the COVID semesters at home, but I feel like I had a fair amount of control most of the time. There were some occasional times where I'd have to work late, trying to get stuff in before midnight; but that didn't happen very often. Most of the time, even if I didn't get it in before midnight, it wasn't a big deal really. So I think I had a fair amount of freedom in how I spent my time.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Not a significant change, because for me it was always something like, "Oh, time to do homework, whatever," - it was kind of boring. I never actively hated it or anything like that. I think sometimes, particularly during busy weeks, I'd think, "I still have to do homework before I can go to bed or before I can do this thing", but that wasn't very often. Maybe a couple times a semester around a busy week, where I thought, "I just wanna go to bed, I just wanna be done, but I have homework I have to do - that sucks". <laugh>

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, not much. It definitely came and went a little bit throughout each semester, but from semester to semester I don't think there was any significant change. By the time it got to the end, like I was thinking, "Are we done yet?" But also at the same time, "Oh my goodness, I'm almost done". So they kind of canceled each other out, and I never felt particularly motivated to start a semester or demotivated or anything like that.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

I don't think so...there's maybe a small upward change between first semester and last semester, but not a whole lot. It was mostly just that first semester calc three exam that made me realize, "Oh my goodness, I have to actually focus to do better in this in school". That was the worst grade I got in any semester, a C+ in that class. So I mean, it probably went up a little bit overall on average, but I don't think there was anything significant.  

**Shifting gears a little bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

I mean, at least for school, I never really set goals beyond just "Do it by the due date". That was definitely a realistic goal - I practically always hit the due date. Is that what you're trying to go for here?  

**I mean, whatever goals you would have set back then?**   

I don't think I really set any goals outside of "Keep getting homework done". <laugh>  

**Okay, that's fair. In your education before UofM - and you kind of mentioned this already - were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yeah. 4.0 GPA in high school, tied with my best friend, and yeah. Good scores on SAT - yeah, I was consistently one of the better students in any class.  

**Did you ever feel pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Not really, no. Honestly it was less so than high school, because in high school - since it was a small enough class - everyone knew me and everyone said, "He's a smart kid, let's go ask him for help" and stuff like that. Whereas UofM is just like, "Here's a grade scale", and they don't really care what you get, at least for big lecture classes. They don't know you, no other students really know you either. So I honestly felt less pressured at UofM as far as that goes.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

I mean, it depends on how big it is. I already mentioned that calc exam, when I realized, "Oh my goodness. I almost actually failed an exam". That's never happened before, never even close - so I kind of realized I had to step up my game, not do that again, make sure to get better grades on the next two exams. And I did. Not a whole lot really, but yeah. I realized for something that's important like that - I used it to focus: "Okay, where did I go wrong?" How I react for other small things? I kind of just realize, "Oh, I didn't get that. Oh well," and I move on. That's about it, I think.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I don't really have much of a reaction to anything like that. "You got an A, congrats". Like, okay, thanks. That's really about it. <laugh> I guess I probably got used to it throughout high school, so it doesn't really affect me anymore.

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

It depends a lot, again, on the significance of it. If it's something I've been working weeks on and I finally get it done, it's a huge sigh of relief, and I take a moment to sit back and relax, and then I move on to the next thing. That's how it kind of is at work right now. For small things, I mostly just think "Cool, I did something" and then move on. I don't have any strong emotions on anything, really. <laugh>  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I don't really think of anyone reacting much to anything that I do. Maybe "Cool, good for you". And that's about it.

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yep.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Basically, you've been working super hard for super long and at some point you just are tired of it. You want to be done, you want to switch jobs, you want to drop outta college, you want to - whatever it is, you went too hard for too long on something.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yep.  

**How do you define that in your own words?**  

Thinking that you're not talented enough for whatever you're doing, even though you are. Basically thinking, "This is way too complex". Actually not really like that - it's more "I don't belong in this program, I'm not as smart as all these other people, I'm not as talented as them", but your grades show otherwise and you're just as good as average or whatever. And you do have what it takes; you just don't think you do.

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

I think I had a little bit of burnout that one busy week at UofM, with that 30-hour work week plus school stuff. I definitely felt like I just wanted to lay in bed all weekend, but I couldn't do that because I had a 12 hour shift to go to. I definitely felt that, was a bit burned out there. As far as anywhere else academically. I don't think I have. I feel like due to breaks throughout the semester - spring breaks, there's also that fall break, and enough breaks throughout - I feel like I don't really experience burnout. I think that sums it up.  

**Do you believe you ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Not much. I kind of felt a hint of it first semester, when I realized, "Oh my goodness, I got a C+. I'm a 4.0 student. How did that happen?" But that's really about it. It kind of just went away after that first semester.  

**Okay. How prevalent do you believe burnout was among your peers?**  

I think more than I experienced it, at least. I don't think it was huge and that everyone had it, but I think I had a below average amount of burnout. I don't know. I bet over 50% of students at least had a little bit of it, but it's hard to say.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome was among your peers?**  

That one's harder for me to estimate because like I said, I never really experienced it. But there's been so much talk about imposter syndrome in various classes that I feel like it's more prevalent than I would've expected. Without that, I would guess probably a similar amount as burnout, probably a bit over 50%. Maybe a little bit more burnout, but I don't know - hard to say.  

**How would you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Not a direct correlation, but because I did take summer classes during COVID-19, that took away my summer vacation from me and kind of contributed a bit more to burnout. Still not significantly, really, but definitely a bit more just because I did that. Imposter syndrome...I don't think it really affected that, for me at least.  

**Okay, we are going on record pace for this interview here! <laugh> Couple more questions.**

**Considering everything we've talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work?**  

I don't think I'd say I enjoyed it. There's bits and pieces here where I would say yes, I enjoyed it; but take the average class or average lecture and I'd say no, I probably didn't enjoy it.  

**Okay. How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I was vaguely aware of them - I took AP psychology back in high school, so we kind of covered that a little bit there. Outside of that class, it was pretty much not covered at all by anyone anywhere. So I mean, I was aware of it. That was about it.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I don't think I need to give any advice about imposter syndrome. About burnout. I would tell myself, "Don't stress about money so much. Don't pick up extra shifts if you don't feel like you want to. Just try to stay relaxed, just work a couple shifts a week." I think that's about as much as I would say.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

No, I think I pretty covered everything.  

**All right. That was the shortest interview I've had. <laugh> Thank you.**
