**Okay, as a warm up, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Alright, so I did my undergrad in India in one of the premier engineering schools in India. So the major focus in that school was engineering - of course we had humanities and things like that, but honestly the major focus was engineering. I did my undergrad in electrical engineering, so lots of technical and mathematical background, and probably much less social sciences background. I did take those classes in high school, but not a lot in undergrad.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I would probably classify most of my friends and also people in my degree and program as my peers, more or less. So that would basically mean master's students in ECE would probably be classified as my peers. PhD students are a little different. Maybe my peers because I take classes with them, but kind of not. So I would say I would classify the master's students as my peers. Yeah.  

**And do you have an approximate count on that?**  

I mean, I know about 50 people? 50 to 60 people, I know their name, I've met them a couple of times. I don't know. 50 people probably.  

**How many years have you been in your major?**  

Uh, I guess six years? Yeah. So four years of undergrad and then two years here. So this is the last year for me.

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Ooh. The short answer is...well, okay. So the way that it works in India is you take an entrance exam, which is basically a big exam where you solve physics, chemistry, mathematics, stuff like that. Then on the basis of your score - and you do give your choices at the beginning - you get one of your preference of branches. I got electrical engineering. So that would seem like that's the only thing I got allotted, and that's correct; I did get electrical engineering allotted to me. But then again, I filled in the choice of computer science and electrical engineering at the top. So I got into one of my top choices. So I mean, it's kind of like I chose it, but it was also allotted to me somewhat. That's the story, I guess.  

**Okay. Is there a particular story behind you choosing to do it for graduate school as well?** 

Oh yeah. So that's probably something...so towards the end of my studies, I wanted to go into machine learning. I took a couple of courses in undergrad and did a couple of projects, and then I wanted to continue my studies in that. And so for me, I just thought that it would be a good option to do a master's degree in that particular area. So frankly, I - well, I was looking for programs in computer vision and machine learning. Some schools in the US offer that through computer science, but Michigan offers it through both computer science and ECE. So that's why I chose to apply here. It was more on the machine learning side and not ECE in general. 

**What is your most memorable story about academics at UofM?**  

Good question. I mean, what do you mean by academics? Do you mean courses or does teaching experience count?  

**Whatever you would consider as academics. So if you'd count teaching experience as academic work, then count that.**

Right. So for me, one of the most interesting experiences for me would be when I was a GSI for an undergrad class. The reason why it was interesting for me is because usually, you know, even in my undergrad and in most courses that I take, most of my classmates are from pretty similar backgrounds and, you know, technical experience-wise were pretty much similar. However, when I was teaching this class, there were a large variety of students from different backgrounds. Some of them had a lot of experience in the subject and had taken AP classes and things like that. And some of them were completely new. So for me as an instructor, I had to sort of think about my teaching plan so that I don't assume that this is common knowledge and that everybody would know this. So that was a sort of an interesting academic experience for me. Yeah.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

Uh, let's see...probably close to 70. Or 65? Yeah, 65.  

**Okay. And for an average semester, what is the average number of rest hours you got per week?**  

Well, I would probably sleep an average of six hours a day, so that would be 42. And then a couple of hours in between. I don't know, maybe a good number might be 60 hours of rest including sleep.

**Okay, so 18 hours of rest without sleep?**  

Yeah. 

**Okay, what is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

80 for sure.  

**And for that semester, what is the average number of rest hours you got per week?**

Uh, without sleep, probably like an hour and a half every day. So 10 hours maybe? 9 or 10. Yeah.  

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

Uh, yeah, I guess there were two weeks - not together - where I probably worked like 90, 95 hours. But that was just two weeks in the three semesters that I've been here. So yeah, 95 probably. 

**Can you walk me through that week, or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Well, okay. This was, by the way, a semester when I was a GSI again. This was probably somewhere around one of the really big homeworks; I don't know whether I was preparing it or something like that, but...okay, okay, yeah, I remember. So I don't remember what happened on each day, but it was something like in the first part of the week, I was working on that homework. And then I think we also had to give writeups for midterm assignments at almost the same time, so I was working on that. So that was two major requirements for the GSI work that I was doing. I think that was in the first part of the week.  

On Thursdays I had my weekly research meetings, since I was doing a research project. So I had run a few simulations and get results for that. That was the middle part of the week, and after that, I think early next week I had a submission for a course I was taking. That whole weekend I spent on basically completing the assignment. So yeah, it was sort of divided into three portions. First half or first third was GSI work, the next one was research, and the coursework was the last third. Of course there was overlap, but that's kind of how I was going at it. So yeah, that would be the busiest week in my memory.  

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

Well, not too much. I mean, it depends. If I have, let's say a couple of deadlines that are a few weeks out, I generally have more control in the sense that I can try and divide my time. But usually during the semester, for whatever reasons I don't plan things. It's mostly focusing on or prioritizing what's the next deadline, so usually it's pretty much dependent on what's due at the earliest. There's still a bit of control that I have, but in general, more or less I plan things based on deadlines, um, that sort of pop up, so to speak. So yeah, not too much control.

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah. Um, I guess, well - I was definitely enthusiastic in the beginning, I would say even in my first semester. But I guess, you know, with research work and GSI stuff and coursework, it was sort of, I kind of overloaded myself. At least in the beginning, I kind of was not able to handle this. Obviously with time, I was able to gain a little bit more control. But it's kind of my own doing in a way, but it's also, you know, just...sometimes it just becomes too much to handle, I guess. So there was a little drop in enthusiasm, I would definitely say. Not completely my fault, but still.

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Yes. But this is kind of weird in the sense that before I joined UofM, I was sitting at home in lockdown and literally going nowhere. But coming here, my lifestyle sort of improved in the sense that I got the chance to go out and do things. But if you compare my undergrad versus when I joined UofM, yeah, it's definitely a lot more work than undergrad. So I would say a decrease in energy level, but if you compare to right before I joined, it's been slightly better, I guess. More energy, things like that. But yeah. 

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

So what do you mean by trend?

**So compared to your grades from your first semester, are your current grades better or worse?**  

Oh, uh, slightly worse, but pretty much similar. That's okay. So the third semester was the hardest. I guess I had too much work, so I did suffer a little bit, but not too much. The overall trend is pretty much similar, with a little dip at the end.  

**Okay. Shifting gears a bit, when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Uh, okay...I'll talk about short term goals during school and not long term goals, because they're too long term. Generally they are realistic to the point that if I'm able to follow through with a set path, I would probably achieve those. In general, I would say I plan them to be a little bit more than - like I might not achieve them. So they're a little ambitious in that aspect, but I would say I generally achieve up to 70% to 75% of the goals. And this is essentially, you know, "I need to finish this by, let's say Friday", and so if I'm able to do it by Saturday, I would say that's pretty much accomplished. Maybe not completely, but something like that. Sorry, what was the second part of the question?   

**Um, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**

Right. Consistency was, well, I would say close to 60% of the time I'm able to accomplish whatever I said completely. And then 30% or 25% of the time, I achieve those goals to an extent, but not completely. And then the remaining, whatever, 15% I kind of fall flat and, you know, I'm not able to complete anything. So yeah, that's how I would characterize that.  

**Mm-hmm.** 

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

I would say that, yeah.  

**Okay, how so?**  

I was in the top 1% terms of GPA out of around a thousand students at my campus. I also received what they called a merit scholarship, which was basically tuition waivers based on GPA. So, yeah.  

**Okay. Do you, or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Um, yeah, to an extent, yes. Not always, but sometimes. Uh, superhuman in the sense that - so for me, the kind of tasks that I get are achievable, but in order to achieve those, I need to be extremely, extremely efficient. I need to have like a superhuman level of efficiency to complete tasks within a given timeframe, so that they don't roll over into the time for other tasks. I feel that I have the capability to do those things, but it's just that I need to be able to perform at a hundred percent all the time, while making sure that I finish tasks on time. It's...so the way that I like to think about it is, let's say I have six tasks.  

If I had all the time in the world for say one task out of those six, for any time and any task out of those six, I would probably be able to complete that task within the stipulated time. However, the issue is that there are six tasks and I have 24 hours, let's say, so I need to complete each task within four hours. Then in order to do that, I need to be performing at a hundred percent across all of those 24 hours; I cannot take a break in between. That's the kind of superhuman efficiency I would say that I need to have, or I feel that I need to have in order to do everything.   

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

I never liked it before, but I've sort of gotten used to it now. I guess one of the eye-opening moments for me was applying to grad school. I kind of had more expectations from myself, so there were a lot of factors involved in that. Because there was the pandemic and a lot of other things involved, a lot of schools reduced their intake. Things like that. But anyway, I felt that a couple of times I could have done so much better in my applications and GRE scores and things like that. But yeah, after that, I've kind of started or developed this sort of understanding with myself that it's okay. Just, you know, learn from mistakes and keep on going and don't take failure as the final thing. It's just a step in this whole life that we live. So yeah, I guess that's how I would say my relationship with failure is.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Well, it's weird because I don't know. I actually don't know how to react. It just, uh...it's okay. Or - I don't know how to respond to praise. I guess I don't receive too much praise also, so I don't know. Not, not sure is my answer.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Well, I guess the first is relief that I was able to do something that I planned on doing. Obviously a little bit of happiness. I usually try to give myself a small break or go out and eat something that I like to eat. Just get a little time for myself. But you know, often it's in the middle of something else, so I don't have too much time to enjoy successes, I guess. Um, yeah, I just try to do what I can.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I guess I don't know. Most people might be a little happy, but in my experience, people are so busy, so they just come up and they congratulate you and then they just move on with their own jobs,  which I understand. Because yeah, grad school is tough and most of my friends here are in grad school, so I don't want people to, you know, just spend so much time congratulating me. But yeah, some of my close friends are pretty happy, but in general people are like "Yeah, good job", and then they just move on. 

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

I have, yes.  

**How would you define it in your own words?**  

Well, for me, burnout is...I don't have a strict definition, but I'll just share my thoughts on it. One thing I would definitely say is that burnout is a complete loss - or not complete, but a very high level of degradation in your enthusiasm to do something. Then secondly, it's a pretty high drop in productivity for whatever reasons that might accompany burnout, whether it's, uh, tiredness or low energy or things like that. So those two sort of, uh, definitions, I guess.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes, I have.  

**And how would you define that in your own words?**  

Well, it's essentially the idea that - it's basically people who join something, some new company or grad school or some, some place; and they feel that they are inferior or that they got in by mistake and that everybody else is better than them, and that they're an imposter in the midst of highly qualified people. 

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**

Burnout? **Absolutely**. 100% towards the end of each semester. The last month of each semester is just burnout month for me, for sure. Towards the end of it, it becomes “Let's just get this semester over with". I just try to do the bare minimum that I can to try and get everything done, so that the semester finishes. So, yeah, for sure. 

**Could you elaborate a bit on some of your experiences with burnout?**  

Yeah. Let's see...say first semester, towards the end, I think we had a final, we had a project, and I think a few other things that were due. So towards the end, what was happening was because there were certain deadlines where three or four days later I'd have to submit this. I was at a point that what I would do was - so in general, I would like, complete an assignment, then just go through it again, check if everything's all right, then verify a few things, stuff like that. But at that point, I was so done with everything that I finished it, and then I just kept it aside. And I thought, "I don't wanna look at this again for my entire life, because I'm just so done with all of this".  

Then in between projects, or - so let's say I finished one thing. Usually I would say "Okay, let's take a break for a couple of hours, go see somebody, go outside", stuff like that. I couldn't do that because I had more work. Then it's just, the cycle sort of continues. And even though I don't hate doing what I want to do, like I might be doing a project for a course that I like; but it's just that because of the previous cycle and that there was so much work, then I just, I just kind of - I don't hate it, but I just, I just...I don't know. It's hard to describe. But I just don't want to do whatever it is that's remaining.  

Somehow I get through it. But I don't like that time is what I would say. Well, I don't enjoy completing the assignment or doing whatever it is. So that's kind of how I would say it goes, although not to exaggerate: this feeling is not there the complete time, but sometimes in the middle I get frustrated. So let's say I'm coding and I have a bug and I get so frustrated that I start thinking about this - but, you know, let's say I'm able to solve that. It's okay. I mean, I get back to my normal self. But this feeling does pop up once in a while. So that's how I would say burnout is, because in general, I tend to be not so easy to perturb. But during that time, I'm on edge and frustrated and things like that. 

**Okay.**  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Uh, sometimes. But I would say it's not, not very common for me, I don't feel imposter syndrome too much. It has happened once in a while for sure, but from what I've heard, it's not as common as how other people feel imposter syndrome. I think definitely towards the very beginning, that's when most people experience imposter syndrome. And so did I. Because for me, it's not just grad school, it's kind of a different system of education. In India we focus more on exams, and here it's a more continuous evaluation, so to speak. You know, you have assignments and class participation and super comprehensive projects. Back home, our projects were never this comprehensive. So obviously I saw people who are used to this system, essentially people who did their undergrad in the US. I felt that they had a much better handle of their time, so time management, versus me. In the beginning, I was terrible at it.  

So I guess then, the major peak of imposter syndrome was present for me. The first maybe first two months is when I felt, "Oh, people here are able to do everything on time and focus on everything". And it was kind of like that. But after that, I kind of got used to it and the imposter syndrome started to go away a bit. And then once more was during these internship applications; I just felt that, you know, people are getting internships at these big companies and - I was pretty late in getting an internship, so that's when another imposter syndrome sort of thing kicked in. Finally I did get an internship, so it's not there anymore. But it appears once in a while, but it's not super common for me.  

**Mm-hmm.**

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

**Super, super prevalent**. I don't think I know anybody who did *not* experience burnout. The degree of burnout might be different for different people, but I think most people towards the end of the semester are pretty burned out for sure. So I would say it's pretty common.  

**Are you able to elaborate on that? Or is it other people's stories that you can't really share?**  

Yeah, I don't think I can share most stories. But I would just say that in general, whenever a few of my friends meet, we just discuss, you know, things that are going on. And sometimes it becomes this, you know, people start ranting about their courses and things like that. So it feels that everybody has some sort of burnout. 

**Okay. How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

I think it's similar to mine in that - in the first semester, I remember a couple friends pretty much had all symptoms, so to speak, of imposter syndrome. A lot of them just wanted to drop out and go home. I don't know how serious they were, because it's hard to tell whether they were being sarcastic or not, but I think definitely during my first semester here, people who joined with me had issues. And for even people who joined later - I feel that the first semester is like, the highest time where you experience imposter syndrome. But I feel that most of them have gotten used to it with time. So imposter syndrome is something that I think a lot of people experience in the beginning, but not so much later. That's just my opinion, I guess.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

So I'm not entirely sure. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, my first semester here was remote. For me, I guess in a way that helped, because I generally like to stay at home to study and focus. I know a lot of people who like to collaborate and things like that, so the pandemic did impact them negatively. However, I will say that because of the pandemic, opportunities for socializing did reduce for me. For me in general, whenever I feel burnt out, I like to talk to people about, you know, just about anything. Just to get my mind off work. And so due to the pandemic and staying at home, it was difficult, I would say, to find people to talk to. So I would say that that sort of affected my approach during the pandemic. As for imposter syndrome...I don't know. I don't think there was any major impact from COVID-19 on imposter syndrome. I'm not sure. For me, like I said, most of it was during my first semester, so I don't really see a lot of connection between those two, I guess. 

**Close to wrapping up: considering everything we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yeah, I still do enjoy academic work. I would definitely say that - like I am interested in doing research, but I don't know if I can do research for a long time as a PhD student. So that's something I kind of realized once I came here, but I don't think that's because of burnout or imposter syndrome. I just feel like research is hard, and I kind of see myself as more of a person in industry. So it's not purely because of that, more because I discovered it by myself through courses and other experiences. 

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Not a lot. I mean, I did experience burnout, and I was sort of aware about burnout and how it sort of is. But like I mentioned, back in undergrad, it was...the issue that I see with burnout is because the whole semester is so difficult, I kind of feel like you don't get enough breaks in the middle. Versus back home, most of my semester was free except during midterms and finals. So I guess burnout builds over time, so it's kind of like the stress builds up and then it peaks towards the end, and that's when you feel maximum burnout. So I did experience burnout before, but I think it was not at the same level that I have experienced here. And then imposter syndrome is something that's new that happened with me in grad school; that pretty much wasn't there in undergrad for me. So yeah.

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Well, for imposter syndrome, I would say don't worry about it too much. Just keep doing what you're doing, and trust everything will be okay. For burnout, I would say - so first of all, the biggest advice that I would give myself is manage your responsibilities responsibly. Sometimes, just be aware of how much you can handle and make sure that you only take on work that you can do, and not more than what you can accomplish. So that would be it.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Uh...yeah. I would definitely say to people who feel burnout or imposter syndrome, I think the best way is just to talk to people, whether it's your peers or some licensed professional. Just, just don't keep it to yourself. That's the worst thing that you can do to yourself. Just speak yourself out, even if it's to your cat or whatever - just don't keep it to yourself. You'll definitely feel better once the words are out of your mouth. That's all.  

**Alright. Well that concludes this interview, thank you for participating.** 

Yeah, sure. No worries.
