**Tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

I went to school in Michigan, an IB diploma school. That's about it.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I mean, I guess I'd include my whole grade as peers, um, which is several thousand? <laugh>

**Okay. How many years have you been in your major?**  

Two.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

I had a really hard time picking a major, but I was really involved with robotics in high school. And because I was involved in the programming side, I think people were very excited for me 'cause they're like, "Whoa, computer science, that's a cool field". So then I was excited, so I'm like, "Okay, I'll do computer science", 'cause I didn't really have any other ideas. That's how I chose my major.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Academics...it's easy to remember the bad things as opposed to the good things. My memorable thing is when I had a technical difficulty and I wasn't able to submit one of my finals until two hours later - and I was also on the edge of failing that class. But they took pity on me and they apparently didn't take any points off. It was extremely stressful because I wasn't sure - because they said that they would not accept it after the time - so I was just really lucky that they did. Yeah.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

I don't know, 50 to 60? There's a lot of in-between because there's a lot of thinking about things and then when I'm kind of working but kind of not working...but somewhere around that mark. 30 to 70 is the range. <laugh>  

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester? When I say waking rest, I mean time that you're taking to relax during the day.**  

Oh...my first semester, like an hour. But I think as my semesters went on, I prioritized it more. So I made myself have more time, so it just increased to two or three hours.  

**Okay, and that's per day?** 

Yeah, per day. 

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

In my busiest semester...probably around that 70 mark because I was taking a lot of high project classes that ended up taking...there were a few weeks, because it depends on the week, based on computer science projects. Because if there's a week that you have a big project due - like I had days that I was working the entire day nonstop. So it just really depends on the week, but yeah.  

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week for that semester?**  

Um, does it include non-curricular activities? Er, extracurriculars?  

**If you would call extracurricular activities relaxation, then go ahead and count that. But I know sometimes it's not relaxation, so...**  

Yeah. I don't think I'd count my activities as relaxation.  

**<laugh> Okay.**  

I probably only had 30 minutes a day then, because I was doing work during lunches and stuff. Yeah. It's really busy.  

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

Um, I don't know. A lot? <laugh> I dunno how many hours are in a week? I could do that pretty quickly. I dunno, like a hundred? Yeah.  

**Can you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Yes, I can do that. So the week I'm thinking of...weeks like that usually follow a week that I wasn't working very well, so a lot of work builds up. But I remember there was a week that I basically had a project due and I decided that I would work on it these two days, and then it ended up taking way too much time. So I spent four days working on it solid. And then I was behind, I had another project due two days after the other one was due. So I had not started that. So I basically had an entire week of just working on projects and trying to cram in my other homework. That's what that looked like.  

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

Uh, it depends on how much I prioritize my schoolwork. Because if I number one, prioritize my school work, then not a lot. But I do have complete control because I can decide how much I wanna work on my schoolwork - like I can decide if I wanna try to get an A or not. So I guess I have complete control, but it... <laugh> But if I wanna get really good grades, then I have very little control.  

**I see.**  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yes. My enthusiasm was really high when I started, higher than high school. Just because it was really exciting. starting to go to university! And then I had a lot of mental health issues, and then I kind of learned to prioritize other things and not like, put so much mental energy. So my enthusiasm has decreased from a lot of health issues.  

**Okay. Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Yes. I experienced...I had, like, a depressive episode, from the end of my first semester all through my second semester of attending UofM; and I had no energy. I had, like, I had nothing. So, so yes.  

**Okay. Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Not really, surprisingly. My grades have slightly decreased, but not significantly.  

**Okay. Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

I'm not very good at setting realistic goals, at least for plans of what I'm gonna do per day. I usually overestimate my ability. And I'm really bad at time management, so I guess I need to think out exactly what I can accomplish and time myself and things like that, instead of overestimating. But it's been a process of learning what I can actually do during a day.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

No, not really. I think part of that was that I went to a school where there was a lot of really strong students, so I just didn't particularly stand out.    

**Do you or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Um, yes. I think that a lot of people at UofM are just very active. Even in their free time, they have a bunch of different activities that they do really well at and they're really passionate about. So I think there's pressure to just excel at everything, which isn't always a good idea. Sometimes you need a break.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

Hmm...I don't know. I think I struggle a lot with failure. I struggle with the fear of failure, but when I actually fail, it's not so bad. <laugh> So it's almost easier to like, accept failure than to work really hard for something and then fail.

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Academic praise? I don't think I'm very good at accepting compliments. I usually don't take it very, uh - I'm always like, "Oh, it was an easy class" or "I got lucky". Yeah, I don't think I'm very good at accepting praise.

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Relief? <laugh> But it depends on what kind of success. If it's just academic, like doing well in a class, that's kind of a relief because it doesn't feel like an achievement, because it's just a class? But if it's working on a specific project or if I'm interacting with a professor, specifically - CS classes don't have a lot of feedback, but I took one of my minor classes, and you meet with a professor. When I get success in that context, like a little bit more of a personal context, it feels like more of an achievement because it's a little bit more detailed feedback. So I can accept it a little bit easier.  

**Okay.**  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

It depends on who, but I think a lot of people, if I talk about succeeding and they're struggling, it just makes them feel worse about themselves. So I think that's something to be careful about. But if they're people that care about me who aren't struggling with the same things, then they're happy when I succeed.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

I think it's putting a lot of mental energy into one specific thing until you've used up your physical and mental abilities.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**And how would you define that in your own words?**  

It's when you falsely compare yourself to others in a way that...you believe that you don't fit into whatever role or position or environment you're in.  

**Okay. Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yes.  

**Could you elaborate on some of your experiences with burnout?**  

Yeah. Um, again, I think because I had a depressive episode - I think a lot of that was related to again, going really hard on something, but also specifically only focusing your energy into one thing. With the pandemic, I was basically fully focusing on academics, because there really wasn't much else to do and I was pretty isolated. So it's a lot easier to have your stresses and everything tied to your schoolwork. And then when you fail or when things are hard, it's really hard to deal with it mentally. So it's easy to detach from your schoolwork and not care anymore, 'cause it seems impossible.  

**Do you believe you experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yes.  

**And then could you elaborate there as well?**  

Yeah. I think I have in a minor way, in several experiences. Even when I did robotics in high school - honestly, the mentors were really bad. I remember one of the mentors saying "If you can't figure out how to do this, you'll just be kicked from this". Because they had too many people, so they were in a kind of attitude of "Okay, the people who really wanna be here will be the people that work hard", and that came out as "If you're not good enough, you don't belong here". So of course, someone who doesn't have experience is gonna assume that it's not good to ask questions and that it's not good to expose their uh, what knowledge they don't have. I also have ADHD, which impacts my learning a lot. It's really easy to think that because I'm not learning in the same way other people are, then I must not be as smart or as whatever. But it's really just like...I know that I can learn. It's just my brain works a little bit differently, so I need to find strategies that work for myself. So I experience that in little doses, I think, all the time.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I think it's very prevalent. I know a lot of people that are struggling. I became friends with a lot of freshmen last year, and a lot of them had a really hard time their second semester freshman year. And a lot of them considered dropping out despite being star students in high school and really putting a lot of time and energy into their classes. So I think it's really common.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

Super common, though I think with the nature of imposter syndrome, people try to hide it. <laugh> I know it's common because, like, it has to be. I think it's just natural that if you're in a high pressure environment and there's people who are pretty talented or good academically, you're going to have a lot of people with imposter syndrome. But again, I think people hide it, so it's not automatically visible.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

It's increased my awareness and experience. Again, I think COVID has - specifically me, or like, a lot of people - COVID has isolated them pretty heavily. And when you're isolated, you lose...you lose those casual conversations with your peers, which may be the conversations where you realize that other people are struggling with the same things you are. So when you don't get to realize other people are struggling with the same things you are, it's easy to assume "Okay, I'm the issue". And it's easier, I think, to have imposter syndrome and burnout. Especially with things being shifted online too; a lot of people have a hard time paying attention, and I have a hard time engaging. It's easy to feel disconnected and I think burn out easier, 'cause it's, I think, maybe worse for your physical health.  

**Okay, we're actually close to wrapping up. We went through that really fast.**   

Oh no! <laugh>  

**Hah, that's not a bad thing. Considering everything that we talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yes. ...should I elaborate?  

**Uh, yeah. <laugh>**  

Honestly, I don't think it's an issue so much with the work. I think it's anything that you put a lot of yourself into and a lot of your time into, it's easy for it to consume you or for you to put too much of yourself into it. But when you take a step back and you take a break, you can realize, like, "Why did I choose to do this in the first place?" Yeah.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I knew that it was a thing that a lot of people dealt with, but I don't think I...I don't think I respected it as much. And I didn't realize that it was as respected, because a lot of people talked about it, and a lot of people accepted that it existed, and it made me think of it as more of a serious issue. And because I was experiencing it too, it made me think of it as a lot more serious and present than just, you know, something that some people experience or some people who have mental illness experience, instead of something that everyone can experience.  

**If you could send a message yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I would just say to prioritize myself. It's just not worth it. If anything is making you stressed - a little stress is fine, but if anything is causing you any sort of unhappiness, it doesn't matter. Like it's okay if you fail some classes, it's okay, even if you need to take a semester off or anything like that. It's just not worth it. Especially being a young adult, this is your time to not just grow academically, but grow as a person and try new things. So if you're not doing that, then this is all pointless. <laugh> There's a lot more to college than academics.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Um, not really. I mean, I can talk more about how ADHD has impacted me, but that's about all I got.  

**Sure, we can go there if you'd like.**

I think COVID has impacted...I think it's made it harder for a lot of people with ADHD, because, um, it's just so easy to not pay attention. It's just so easy to not go to class, it's so easy to turn off a camera. And without accountability...it's just really hard to do anything. I think everyone struggles with that, but especially people with attention issues. Um, what was I gonna say? Shoot. I don't even know. <laugh> But yeah, I dunno. Medication helps me? That's it.  

**In that case, we can stop there and I'll stop recording.**
