**So as a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Um, I attended high school, and I was in China since before high school.  

**Okay.**  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I count all my classmates, so people attending the same class and people in the same clubs and organizations as me, and whoever did the same projects for some competition or studying. So I consider the people I know, or I interact with, who I could be interacting with on some scale, as my peers.

**Approximately how many people are your peers?**  

I would consider maybe 1000, 2000 kind of. Because this is about how many people are in my classes for each semester. And then plus other people I could be interacting with, maybe a thousand.

**How many years have you been in your major?**  

I just concluded my second year.  

**Okay. What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Um, I did robotics in high school, and I just thought it would be cool to keep going, to keep doing this. And I thought computer science was a great start to do some higher-level robotics.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**

Uh, doing EECS 280 euchre.  

**Could you elaborate on that?**  

It's, like, a complete project. I have to start from, like, learning how to do it, and then collaborating with my friends, and writing and just like coding it and keep doing it. And I pulled a couple all-nighters for that. It's a good project. I only collaborated with one person, but we had the process of learning how to play euchre and discussing, um, the bugs. I made some friends, and we were, we are code buddies ever since.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

Outside of counting the classes, I usually start a day from whenever classes start - so maybe 11, 10 - and then minus the lunchtime and dinnertime, I study till like 12 or 1 at night. So maybe 10 hours per day? And then six days per week. So like 60 hours, counting my classes. There was also things I was doing for the school.  

**Okay. What is the average number of rest hours you got per week in an average semester? Rest hours being time you take off during the day.** 

Okay. Outside that 10 hours, I get eight hours of sleep every day. So maybe six to eight hours. I would say about six hours, 6, 7, 8. 

**So then, like, 42 to 56 hours of rest per week?**

Yeah, 40...yeah. That is just an average. Maybe like two or three weeks before finals, I wouldn't even do that. It's just average.

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Um, I would say I just wake up to study - maybe I wake up at 9 to study and then eat. Eating, I would even just make it a 10 minute thing and then just go to sleep at like two or three. So 12 to 13 hours per day, and then for seven days a week. It's like, 80 hours? <laugh>  

**Okay. And then for that semester, what was the average number of rest hours you got per week?**  

Just 10 hours. Maybe just eating time and that's it.  

**Okay.**  

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

Uh, just that week. 

**That week you just described?**

Mm-hmm.

**Okay, and you said it was 80?** 

About 70-something, 80. Yeah.

**Can you walk me through that week?**  

So I took five classes that semester and three major classes. I just walk through all the Piazza posts and see all the recordings for, like, final review, and whenever there's something that I don't understand, I would probably go back to the class lecture recording. And then if there's something further I don't understand, wait on the office hour queue. Just repeat, like, repeat this.  

Just for classes. Classes or things that I don't understand. This might be like two weeks before final, so it's pretty close. So I have to study, like two or three weeks before.

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I would say plenty, a big amount. I think I can control my life in college when I don't have friends come by.  

**Can you repeat that last part?**  

Uh, when I don't have friends come over. So if I have friends coming from another college on their spring break to Ann Arbor, maybe I just don't have enough control over. But other than that, I think I'm - I can decide when I wanna go to go to the library, go to the NCRB, or go do whatever.

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, but it has gone back. So in the beginning, I definitely like to study because I don't know where are my peers - like, what my peers do? Because, um, I came from a very competitive high school, and people just study all day and I have to study all day. But during I think second semester or third semester, I've realized maybe my enthusiasm has gone, I didn't study as much; but then now, I feel like my academic content is getting interesting again - like it's getting interesting. So I start to do whatever I did in the first semester.  

So that has gone on for one or two semesters.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

No. For those two semesters' energy level, I would say I spent more time in the gym or making more friends. Academic level, I didn't do as much, but I had the energy. I didn't just sleep at home or just do nothing.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, I did for those two semesters - more for the third semester. I would say the second semester was just fine. For the second semester of sophomore year it has gone back. So I dropped one semester.  

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?** 

For goals? Like for a to-do list, I complete everything, but for the goals, maybe I didn't - so I would say my goals were like, “Go to the gym once every two days”. It just eventually became “Go there once per week”. So I didn't completely drop my goal, but it became less frequent, er it didn't, like, meet the frequency of the standards of my goal.  

**And would you say that your goals are usually realistic or unrealistic?**  

I say my goals are usually a little bit beyond realistic, like a little bit over what I would do. So even though I didn't meet a goal, it's just fine.

But yeah, sometimes I do over the realistic. Sometimes it's just realistic; but I don't set my goals to be a lot lower than realistic because I know I'm gonna not meet that goal. So I'd rather just study higher.

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yeah.  

**Okay, how so?**  

Um, I was in the top 10 of my school. Not the strongest, but pretty academically strong.  

**Do you or did you ever feel pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Super what?  

**Sorry, superhuman?**  

Um, no. I think 'cause this is the best of the best from all the high schools over the country. So I think as long as I'm average, I'm meeting the goal, because academically you don't have to be very strong to be just a good human.

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

With failure? Um, I think I've become friends with failure here. <laugh> Because I recognize...I realized what I can do, and then other than that, as long as I'm trying and have a goal on when to achieve that, I'm fine with not achieving it right now.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Um, I took those as nothing, 'cause I know just how American appraisal works. Like people just praise for nothing, so I would say - because I usually praise everyone for whatever they do, but that's just like...I don't know the details. I would just praise because they did this, so it's worth complimenting. But I would just be like "Thank you" and that's it, because I know there's a lot more that I can do. I can't just take the compliment and do nothing.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

I would be happy because it was worth my time and efforts to do this.  

**Mm-hmm.**

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I dunno. Um, I would say for most people, they would be happy for me too, or my good friends. But here it's...it's so weird, that in sophomore year I encountered some things within a club. They didn't even know me, and they just envy me and say bad things about me. So I would say if I had success on some scale, they would be not very happy. But other people, like all my friends, would be happy for me.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**

Yeah.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Uh, working too hard that you lose your life for a long time for a couple of days, or for a long time. So if you just keep working and don't have work-life balance, that would be burnout, and you just lose yourself completely. That's a burnout. Yeah.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Uh...I think I missed what imposter syndrome means. Could you just remind me on what, like, settings?  

**Sorry. Are you asking me to repeat the question or...?**  

Uh, no, just on the circumstances which you use imposter syndrome. 'cause like, is that the thing when you don't think you can do it, but actually you can do it? That?  

**Well, I can pull up a definition I used to help create my questions...**

I remember in orientation, they were talking about imposter syndrome, which is like, "You can do it and all your peers can do it, but you just don't believe you can do it and you just don't believe in your ability".  

**I mean, that's pretty accurate. There's not one single clinical definition of imposter syndrome. I used a couple, but the one that I'll read to you is that imposter syndrome "describes high-achieving individuals who despite their objective successes, fail to internalize their accomplishments and have persistent self doubt and fear of being exposed as a fraud or imposter".**

Yeah. Gotcha. Uh, the question was, did I feel imposter syndrome? 

**Um, the question was to define it in your own words, which you did. You also asked me to define it, so uh, yeah.**

<laugh> Okay. Yeah.

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah, it's just before every EECS projects. On my definition, I - I don't think I can do it because it's too complicated, but I just eventually find a way to get past it.  

**Sorry, that's burnout? Or imposter syndrome?** 

Oh, imposter syndrome.  

**Oh, okay. That's fine 'cause I was gonna ask about imposter syndrome next, but in that case - do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

I definitely think at some points that I feel like I'm lost and I can't do it anymore; but then I think it's normal. Because right now I don't even remember what point that was. So it might be just one feeling on some days that I work really hard, but it's nothing thinking back now.  

**Okay. How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I think in my major, it might be very common, because other than the very heavy workload, they also have to do a lot of practice problems for interviews and for everything else, and do projects outside of class. But I'm not sure about other majors.  

**Okay. And how prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

Yeah, I would say maybe pretty common.  

**Could you elaborate?**  

It's just everyone coming to the university feeling unsure about their ability and knowing everyone else is very capable of doing everything - a lot of things. And they feel discouraged on many things.

**Okay. How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah, I think, if it's not for COVID, I would do everything in person and not online. I'd say I might experience more burnout situations because I'd just have to be in school every day, but also being with friends and being with like, TAs and professors in the same room would help me, would reduce the level of burnout. So I don't know, it might be better or worse. For imposter syndrome, if I'm in the same classroom as others and I know what they're doing, like clearly - because compared to if it's online, I don't know what they're doing at home. Being in the same room as them also could help the imposter syndrome, because everyone else would just be the same level and they could do it, so I could definitely do it.  

**Mm-hmm. We are close to wrapping up, so: considering everything we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yeah. As of right now, I'm learning everything. I'm having fun with the major and projects that I've been working on, so I would consider it's successful or pretty good. It's going better.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Um, I didn't hear these terms as much. It's just from student orientation that I heard this and realized this actually exists among a lot of students.  

**Okay.**  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and/or burnout?**  

I would say college is definitely not about just only academic experience. Experiencing a life outside academics would probably reduce my burnout level, because being outside or being in nature or being with friends definitely counters the academic stress and imposter syndrome. You are who you are, don't race with anyone 'cause...you can see what your ability is, but definitely don't overthink, don't overachieve - not overachieve, but over-stressing the goals or just thinking everyone is better than you.

That's what I would say to myself two years ago.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Um, I don't have anything else to add.  

**All right, cool, that is a wrap. Thank you for participating and I'll stop the recording here.**
