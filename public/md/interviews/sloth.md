**Okay, as a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

So I did my first two years of high school in my home country, last years of high school in Michigan. um...what more should I say? Oh, and my first three semesters of college were at a different university, and then I transferred to UofM in the middle of my sophomore year.  

**Okay. Yeah, I mean, whatever you feel is appropriate here.**  

Yeah, I don't have anything more to add, unless you have any specific questions.  

**No, that was sort of exploring any interesting facts. Okay, approximately how many people did you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

As my peers at UofM...I would say a handful. Somewhere between five and 10.  

**Okay.**  

**How many years were you in your major?**  

That would be three and a half. I did the first year-and-a-half at a different institution. Yeah.   

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Deciding on my major...Ah. So when I was in my old institution, I was initially an engineering student, and in my engineering course, it was mainly two parts. One of them was basically designing structures using the SolidWorks software, if you've ever used that; and the other part of it was the coding part. That was my first time coding, and the language was C or C++ if I'm remembering correctly. And that class, I hated the SolidWorks part and I feel like engineering is mostly about that - so I was like, "Okay, I don't want this", and at the same time I had this professor who was giving a talk one day about - I don't really remember what it was about, um - actually it was about the mathematical concept behind guessing games, which involved binary search.  

And I really liked his talk and I went and talked to him afterwards, and he said "Do you wanna do a project, like an independent study kind of project like this?" I did that, and after that semester pretty much, I said "I want to do a math major". I also did a lot of research, so I felt like doing a math major would open a lot of doors to me; and I could do engineering or whatever with a math bachelor's. So I was like, "I like this, it has great career potential, so why not?" So I did a math major then, and I was actually doing a math and physics double major then. When I transferred to UofM, I was taking physics classes still, so I was actually one class away from a physics minor - I was gonna do a double minor - but towards the end I was like, "Fuck this year, I don't wanna do the physics minor". So I only kept a math major. And yeah, that was the story! A really good professor inspired me to become a math major.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM? Or one of your most memorable stories.**  

The most memorable story? Because in general I have a terrible memory. <laugh> My most memorable story...

I guess this is not a story - well, okay, here's the thing. So I was taking, what was the class number? Was it 525? Is that the probability course? So it was a probability course in the math department, and in the math department, it was known as being an easy A. So I was taking that class, I was doing fine with the homeworks, blah, blah, blah, and I didn't take the midterms seriously, so I didn't really study for it. And during the midterm, I remember it was only four questions, and one of the questions - and the professor had told us this, that it would be a homework question, like one of the questions directly from the homework, and I was just so confident in my abilities that I didn't even bother reviewing the homework questions.  

So it was four questions, one of them was straight from the homework, and I was struggling on each and every one of them. And I remember being so anxious during my exam that I just started tearing up in the middle of my exam, and - you know when you're so stressed where you just can't think anymore? That was me that time. I had given up on thinking and I just wanted that exam to end. I finished that exam, I just start crying, blah, blah, blah. So it was a really bad exam, and I think I got like for sure...I mean, later on, I figured out that everybody had done not too well, but the fact that I didn't know how to answer the question that was straight from the homework was just terrible. So it was way below average, really bad.  

It was a really stressful experience, especially because it was this class known for being an easy A. I had a friend who told me "It's known that if you have a pulse, you'll get an A in this class", so I was like, "I might as well just be dead!" <laugh> So I feel like this was one of those things at UofM that I didn't really appreciate, because that semester, that professor was hard! Then fast forward: for the final exam, I did really, really well. I got an almost perfect score, and I got the maximum score in the class. The professor emailed me saying "Sloth, congratulations, you have the highest score in the class, you've done so well, and I was able to see how much progress you made throughout the semester, so congratulations!" and blah, blah. That was such a fulfilling moment for me, to see how I went from very low lows to a really high high, you know what I mean? It was a very inspiring moment that I created for myself, and I was very proud of me. And I will never forget that. That's a story.

**At UofM, what is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**

Hmm...I would say per day, say an average of two to three hours in classes and an average of five hours doing homework - so let's say seven hours of just doing work. Multiply that by six, I would say, so then somewhere between 40 and 50 hours a week.  

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per semester? That is, rest you take during the day.**  

Does doing my hobby, like dancing, count as rest?  

**If you think of that as restful.**

I totally think of that as rest, yeah. Okay...I don't really remember that well, but I would say six to seven hours a week?  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Busiest semester. Hmm. Somewhere between 50 and 60, I would say.  

**And for that semester, what was the average number of waking rest you got per week?**  

Oh, I don't remember, but I would say somewhere between five and six. One sec, just need to make sure my laptop is charging cause currently it's not...okay, keep going.

**Okay. What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

I really don't remember, honestly.  

**Could you walk me through a particularly difficult week from your busiest semester, if one stands out?**  

Well, I lived off campus, so for me it was mostly...I typically had a class in the morning, so I would come to campus, go to my class, just work on homework until seven or eight-ish - I'm not gonna say I was productive or that I was actively working all that time - but typically I was just working and then would go home at seven or eight.  

Pretty much every day was like that. And I didn't exercise; I didn't have any workout plan during the week or anything. I didn't have any fixed - well, sometimes I took like, dance lessons in the middle of the week, but mostly that's what my days looked like. Yeah. Sorry, I don't remember well enough to have a better answer.  

**That's alright. How much control did you feel you had over how you spent your time?**  

How much control did I feel I had...What do you exactly mean by that? As in I had so much homework that I was forced to spend all of my time on homework, so I didn't have much control over it - like in that sense? Or how much freedom did I have in choosing what to do with my time?  

**Yeah, there's multiple areas to this question. You can walk me through both of those.**  

I would say in a typical semester for me, I felt like most of the time I was just running after getting homeworks done, and in courses where we had readings, I typically didn't have time to do them. So for example, in humanities and social sciences and stuff, I typically didn't have time to do the readings. So in that sense I do feel like I didn't have much control over my time.  

If that answers your question.  

**Most of these questions I'm leaving sort of open-ended 'cause I don't wanna force any one interpretation onto interviewees. So feel free to answer however you wish for most of these.**  

Okay. Okay.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

I would say...I remember first semester I was very motivated, last semester I was so not motivated. <laugh> I don't know if that's because I was just tired of school or if it's because COVID was taking a toll on me and doing online classes was taking a toll on me. But I would say my last year, it felt like I was just dragging myself through the academic year and I did not feel motivated at all.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Again, yes. I feel like the first three semesters maybe, I felt very energetic. That might have to do with the fact that it was a new environment, I was trying to fit in blah, blah, blah, I was excited, felt very energetic. Towards the end, I was so anxious, so not motivated, and not energetic at all. 

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

No, not really.  

**Okay, anything to elaborate on there?**  

Yeah, I feel like I was consistently able to have a very good performance in most of my classes. I didn't see a trend or anything. Even towards the end, even though I was not motivated at all, I was still able to push and do well.  

**Okay, shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Is this question applying to my time at UofM? because I feel like now it's a little bit different.  

**Applying to your time at UofM, but if you want, you can bring up how it's going now as well.**  

Okay. I'm trying to think of goals that I set for myself when I was at UofM...okay. At some point I had workout goals. Started out well, but throughout the semester it died out. <laugh> So I wasn't able to be very consistent with that. What other...I feel like I was - 'cause my main job was to just do well in classes and study, so I didn't have that much time to think of goals in the big picture, if that makes any sense. Well, at some point I did set a goal for myself to meditate daily, and I feel like for a while I was doing a good job of that. But then again, I think in the last year, I got really lazy with it.  

Now in grad school, I'm much better at, as you said, setting realistic goals. And also adjusting them - for example, when I set myself a goal of working out every morning, blah, blah, blah, sometimes I feel like, "Okay, maybe I'm just being too hard on myself". Like if I haven't slept well, why don't I allow myself to work out in the evening? So you know, adjusting the realism of my goals and also allowing flexibility has allowed me to be more consistent with my goals. Also, writing things down has really allowed me to be more consistent with my goals. I don't remember having done that at UofM. 

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or especially strong student?**  

Yes. So both at my first university and also in my high school, I was among the strongest students.  

**Did you ever feel pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

No, not really. I was for sure pushed, very much pushed outside of my comfort zone. But it didn't feel like...I appreciated the fact that professors and the faculty had high expectations of us, but it didn't feel like they were expecting us to be superhumans. Of course, there was an analysis course that I only audited, and that course alone had 20 hours of homework per week. I wasn't doing that, and I did feel like that was a little bit absurd. But I also do think that like, this is one of the reasons people want to go to UofM, so I don't wanna question that; I simply just chose not to take that. That was my personal choice. But other than that, I appreciated being pushed and challenged.  

**What was and is your relationship with failure?**  

With failure?...It's been a learning curve, and I still don't have it down yet. I'm only recently beginning to internalize the fact that just because I failed now doesn't mean that I can't try and fix it. And it doesn't necessarily undermine me as a person, but rather I just need to spend more time on this or be more persistent with it or just try and go learn it. I feel like this is only very recently starting to actually kick in, that it's not - it is a me problem in the sense that I need to go do more, but it doesn't mean that I am not sufficient, if that makes any sense. But before, I think a huge source of my anxiety was that when I failed or when I didn't know something that I thought I should know, my immediate reaction was just stress and blaming myself and like, scolding myself for not knowing that or for not doing enough. Whereas now, I'm like, "Okay, Sloth, it's okay, you've got this. You can go and learn it." So I feel like I'm learning to be kinder to myself when I fail, and I didn't have that when I was in Michigan. I feel I've become better at it, yeah.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Absolutely love it. Positive feedback really motivates me, especially if it's from someone I admire. It gives me a lot of energy to keep going.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Um, pride, joy, motivation, hope, liveliness? Yeah. Those are the things that come to mind.

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

Others being who? Anyone?  

**Your peers, maybe people who you encounter who aren't peers.**  

Okay. Again, they're proud, encouraging, maybe in some cases impressed, I guess? Yeah.  

**Okay. Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Mm-hmm. 

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

I would say it's a kind of exhaustion that is deeply rooted in *time*. And a lot of the times, people don't realize that their lack of motivation and their lack of interest and their state of being stagnant is because of burnout. So in a way, at least to me, it feels invisible a lot of the time. It's the invisible cause for many negative feelings that I'm experiencing. Yeah. That's how I would put it - really deep exhaustion with what you've been doing without taking any break or rest and without really knowing what's causing your lack of motivation.

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How do you define that in your own words?**   

Imposter syndrome is when you feel like you are fake. When you, for example, accomplish something and you believe it was only by look and not by competence. When you feel like you don't belong somewhere, when you feel like your advisor might fire you any moment, um, when you feel like your accomplishments don't really matter. Long story short, when you feel not smart.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yes, for sure. I would say my senior year of undergrad, I was really burned out.  

**Do you care to elaborate? I know you kind of talked about it already.**  

Yeah. It was a time where - especially with all the grad school apps. I was especially stressed about grad school because I was still not sure if I had a good enough reason to go to grad school, and, you know, application processes are just so exhausting. So I was really tired with that, I was tired of my school work; it was a time where it was still COVID quarantine, so most of the time I was home and I wasn't having much social interactions. It was a time where I *thought* that everything was normal and that I was happy, and I didn't really realize that I was exhausted and stressed. But yeah, I was just feeling really stressed, really unmotivated, and it was a bad point in life and I really couldn't pinpoint what was causing it. And now that I think about it, I think it's just because I was exhausted and I didn't know that I was exhausted.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yes, all the time, all the time. How would I elaborate on this? I feel like especially at Michigan, when I experienced imposter syndrome, it was mostly in the form of comparing myself to others. So you know, you're sitting in a math atrium, there are these people who are discussing these crazy complicated mathematical concepts on the blackboard and you don't even understand what they're saying, let alone try and comprehend it mathematically. So those moments, I was like, "What the hell am I doing here?" But I did have a couple professors who - like my 217 professor at that time actually, I felt comfortable talking to them about this. They were very nice and encouraging, and they said, "Sloth, everybody experiences this. Just because they're discussing these things doesn't mean that" - because they told me "Sloth, math is really, really vast, and even some professors don't really know what's happening in other subfields of mathematics. Just because you don't know something doesn't mean that you're not smart or anything, because there will always be something that you don't know." Some professors even told me "Sloth, a lot of people fake until they make it, and just because they sound like they know what they're talking about doesn't mean they actually know what they're talking about." 

So of course I had those feelings all over, but I did feel like when I talked to my professors about this, especially when it was one on one, they were very supportive and very kind. And that really helped. I remember one of my professors especially told me "Sloth, do not compare yourself to anyone, because there will always be someone who's better than you. Just accept that and be at peace with it."  

**Okay. Back at UofM, how prevalent do you believe burnout was among your peers?**  

Um, I'm not sure. Well, I had a couple of friends who I would say were definitely burnt out, but other than that, I'm not sure. Because I wasn't - right now I'm much more social than I was at UofM, so I didn't have a strong sense of community when I was in UofM. So I really don't know what the burnout situation was; but I would say out of all of my friends, I do feel like more than half of them did experience burnout.  

**Okay. How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome was among your peers?**  

Very prevalent, I believe. We never talked about it, but...I sensed it, that it was very prevalent.   

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic affected your awareness and experience with imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

For me, I feel like it didn't really affect it. I guess the only way it might have affected it is sometimes, I did find it difficult to concentrate during online lectures. I would just zone out. But that also happened to me with in-person lectures too, so honestly it didn't really have an effect for me, I feel. Nothing that I can think of.  

**Alright, we are close to wrapping up. Considering everything that we've talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work?**  

For the most part? Yes. For the most part, I really did. There were some courses, like differential equations courses - I did not enjoy those courses for the most part. But other than that, I especially enjoyed the fact that I had a lot of freedom in picking the classes that I wanted. And I did really enjoy my coursework overall, and my experience.

**How conscious were you about burnout and imposter before attending UofM?**  

Interestingly, the professor who inspired me to become a math major at my first institution was the first person to tell me about imposter syndrome. So I was aware of it, which was nice. Burnout, not really aware of it, just thought of it as exhaustion. It always felt that I had to tough it out and keep going, and it didn't occur to me that sometimes I really need to take a break. Because that's a requirement for enjoying my work, and that's something that one of the professors at UofM told me, like "Sloth, just because you're passionate about something doesn't mean that you should always be doing it. Rest is necessary for you to be able to enjoy it." And I really, really appreciated that advice. I would say I learned about it after coming to UofM.

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

That's a great question. Gimme a minute...I would say for a lot of people - and for me, for sure - I think it's really important to be able to distinguish what is imposter syndrome versus what is an actual evaluation of me and my skills.  

Advice I would give myself is - this comes with experience of course - I would try and be better at distinguishing that, because a lot of the times when we feel like we don't know something, it's actually the fact that we don't know it! And the correct approach is not to say "Oh, this is imposter syndrome, I should just not think about this"; the actual approach is to look in the eye, face it, go learn it, and persevere at it. Whereas for imposter syndrome, a strategy that my therapist actually told me is: whenever you're having thoughts of incompetence or just when you're stressed about something in particular, or when you're stressed that, for example, your professor has a really negative view of you - write down to yourself, think to yourself, what evidence do I have that this might be true?  

What evidence do I have that this might not be true? So looking for objective and solid evidence for what it is that you're experiencing that would really help distinguish whether it's actually imposter syndrome or whether it is some lack of confidence that you need to go and work on. So for myself, I would say be better at that. And when I realize that it's a lack of competence kind of thing, don't panic! Because in most cases, it is not about intelligence. It is just about practice, practice, and experience. So just accepting and internalizing this idea, that with practice, it does get so much better, and so all I need to do is just spend more time on it. That is, I think, something I would tell myself.  

**Is there anything you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Nothing comes to mind? No.  

**Alright, in that case, thank you for your participation and I'll stop the recording there.**  

Sure.
