**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Sure. I mean, I don't think it's really relevant if I talk about my elementary school or my middle school, but I'll talk to you a little bit about my high school. Um, I went to a school in Michigan and from what I gather, it's a pretty large high school. It's around 2000 students in one given year, I believe. Yeah. Lots of students there. I guess you wanted me to talk about the school itself?  

**Whatever you feel is relevant.**  

To what question?  

**I mean, just tell me a little bit about your education, just what you think mattered.**  

Sure. What really mattered to me, I guess, was being introduced to Science Olympiad. That's just a club that my school ran to compete in the Science Olympiad tournament, and for the longest time, uh, it didn't really mean a whole lot to me actually. Even in my third year there, as a junior, I had a really nice opportunity to teach other students, which is why I actually do what I do. <laugh> I really like teaching! So that's that, but it wasn't until my senior year where I really got to work with other people in a meaningful manner as a team - that was possibly one of the most joyful experiences, which was working both as a scientist to expand my knowledge, and also work as a team member with truly amazing people that I still have good contacts with.  

So yeah, I'd say that Science Olympiad was by far the most definitive moment in my high school academic career. A close second, though...what was it? I kind of strived to push myself towards academic excellence, but I wasn't super great in terms of that. Like I kind of sucked at English. I really hated writing essays, and so my GPA wasn't, well, it wasn't really the greatest. So instead, I really pushed myself to try to understand more about chemistry, and that was because, I guess, at my junior year I was being taught by a really amazing teacher. And I was also trying to teach other people this information. Uh, of chemistry. Why did I say that? 

Well anyways, what really pushed me to try to learn more about chemistry in general was the Chemistry Olympiad test. To give context, the previous year, I was really bad at chemistry, actually. Even though I was taking chemistry at the time, I practically didn't know how to apply it to any situation or theoretical context. So I did actually really poorly at Science Olympiad that year. <laugh> But when I was teaching it and when I was really learning it, taking this test, showing me that I actually know what I'm talking about - that really pushed me to try to learn more about chemistry. That actually got me into the local exam.  

Basically that's kind of like a training ground for the national Chemistry Olympiad exam. So chemistry, that was really nice. That gave me a lot of confidence in my scientific abilities. And that really pushed me towards pursuing chemistry. I did try a lot of other clubs when I was in high school, but none of them really panned out. None of them were very interesting other than Science Olympiad. I tried out this, like, drone club? It was just me hanging out with some friends. It was meh. Yeah, that was about that.  

**Alright. Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?** 

Okay. Well, I would say peers and friends is really two different things. Friends I feel like I have not that many, but peers is more like people I could closely associate with, so actually quite a fair bit. Hmm, let's see. I'd say 20 or 30 people. Admittedly, when I think about it, that's kind of small; but to be fair, there wasn't a whole lot of opportunity to really meet with people. That's what I found. I did try, it was just more like, uh, there wasn't really a huge motivator - which is actually kind of not a good thing, huh. Just kind of thought about it.  

**How many years have you been in your major?**  

I've been my major for 3.5 years. Er, 2.5. Why did I say three? So ever since freshman winter semester I started BME.  

**Okay. What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Me deciding on my major...I mean, I kind of told you a little bit about that already, how Chemistry Olympiad and Science Olympiad really shaped my idea of becoming a scientist.  I could give you the whole story of...there's a specific event that had to do with bio. I'll give you the short version because it's a little bit too long of a story. Essentially there was an event in Science Olympiad called protein modeling where we model proteins, but the specific protein in that case had to deal with CRISPR. And so there's a lot of medical implications of this new protein we were making - not making, but rendering, I guess I should say. And that's very fascinating. That's kind of what started me on the medical path. Also the chemical path, but more so on the medical, because it was like, "Yo, we can actually make stuff to help other people".  

That really pushed me towards biomedical engineering. And then when I started UMich, it was either chemical engineering or biomedical engineering based off of labs. Just looking at the coursework, I thought that working with enzymes and trying to learn thermo and learn kinetics was boring, too much math - oh, it wasn't too much math. It was more boring math and I didn't wanna deal with it. So I went with biomedical engineering because there was a lot more really interesting stuff, a lot more of that wet lab knowledge. It's also very fun to actually design something. That was actually something I wasn't really anticipating would be a highlight in biomedical engineering, but it thoroughly surprised me as something I enjoyed.  

So that's why I chose biomedical engineering, primarily because ChemE sucked and because I really did want to apply my chemical knowledge in medicine.  

**Okay. What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM? Or one of your most memorable?**  

Most memorable times about academics?...I mean...I mean, I could talk about some good ones. I kind of don't want to...  

**Doesn't have to be good or bad, it can be whatever.** 

*[On request from the interviewee, this story has been excised.]*

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**

What do you define as work? Reading? Is doing homework work?  

**Whatever you would define as work. What would you refer to as doing work during the semester?**  

Well, I'd say attending classes is work, as well as doing homework. Doing reading is also work in some aspect. Then lab is obviously work. Uh, let's see. So I'd be in the lab for, uh, I averaged 16 to 20 hours per week. It's spread over four days, so that's four to five hours per day. That means sixteen hours per week. Then I had my coursework; last year I had 18 credit hours... I'd say that's about right. Um, yeah, that sounds about right, in terms of how much time I put into each. But also, doing homework takes a lot of time, though it depended. Some of them were more difficult than others. Uh, I'd say I spent 30 hours per week on courses and coursework, that sounds about right. 50 hours per week on work. 

**And then what is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester, waking rest being rest that you take during the day?**  

I used to try to experiment with a 30 minute nap every day, but then that didn't really work out. To be honest, I actually don't really take naps, I should say.  

**Oh, it doesn't have to be naps, it can just be whatever you would consider relaxation during the day.**  

Oh, then uh, oh shit. Um, okay. I'd say I relax almost four to five hours per day, and if I'm including cooking, then that's six hours. I mean, in total six hours per day, so 30 hours per week. I dunno if that math works out. I think that a lot of the times when I was supposed to be working, I was actually relaxing. Sorry. It's a little bit inaccurate.

**So six times seven, you get 42. Or...**  

Uh, I guess, yeah. Huh. I guess I wasn't counting the weekends. Weekends I relax a lot more. Okay, bump that up to 50.  

**50. Alright.**  

Yeah, that sounds alright. Because then 50 in total, well, 50+, really 60 hours. So that means...lemme just do some math real quick...probably add in an extra one or two hours, 'cause I know I average around 7.5 hours sleep in a day, so that means that there's a missing 15 hours. 15 hours in the error margin. Sorry, I don't have that like, perfect.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Huh. Maybe 60 hours per week. There is a personal story time that I told you about. There were a couple days where I'd be in lab - or rather, two days in almost sequential order, right? Two days in lab where I worked from 2:00 to 8:00, oh boy that sucked. So six hours of work plus the other work I was doing at the time. Ugh.  

**Just to check, 2:00 AM to 8:00 PM?**  

No, 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Not 2:00 AM. That would be way too long!  

**Okay.**  

**For that busiest semester, what was the average number of rest hours you got per week?**  

Rest hours? I usually try to make sure I...well, that actually leaves me very little time. So I'd say three to four hours per day. Then that means 20 hours per week then.  

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

Like I said, 60.  

**And you already walked through an example, right?** *[This refers to the excised story.]*  

Yeah.  

**Okay. How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I'd actually say a fair bit. There are some things that just happen that I can't control, and obviously there's some things like where I'm given an assignment; I can't really control when I'm given that. And I can't control circumstance leading to that being assigned, but I can do my best to try to assign times that I finish that. So I'd say I have pretty moderate to considerable control over the tasks I'm given.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Well, I mean, it is a little hard to tell because of the personal story I told you. Beforehand I know that I was very enthusiastic, and I know that learning about these things in UofM really pushed me and made me more motivated. But that kind of just happened and that just killed my, you know, motivation. But I'm getting back to being more motivated. <laugh>  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Uh, no. I feel like in some ways I've become a little more excited! Which is a little strange, but it's true. I feel that there's been a lot of times where I, uh, have...yes, I have been a little more stressed. But there's also been a lot of times where I feel way more excited 'cause of the things I'm doing. So yeah. I guess it's a yes and no: yes, I have felt more stressed, and yes I have, um, had a lot of those things happen to me. But I've also felt invigorated to complete some tests and actually really excited to try to do some new projects. So yeah.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Academic results...I mean, because of that incident, I did feel like my academics last semester, I actually didn't do too hot. Also maybe because I was already starting to feel more stressed at the time, because, you know - so I guess it's kind of a little consistent? It was just that last semester, because I had already been feeling a bit more stressed beforehand.

I could tell you the whole story, but that's not the most helpful.

**Okay. Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Realistic? When I set goals, I'd say...time management management has been a skill that I'm still trying to perfect. But sometimes, if it's a product I'm really enthusiastic about, I can nail a time pretty consistently and really achieve that goal. But if it's something I'm not very enthusiastic about or if it's something that I especially don't really know much about, I guess I'm really bad at taking the goal and reaching those goals. So I'd say I'm okay at making goals and then sticking to achieving them if it's like, a personal goal - that's something I know I can achieve. But if it's something that's more...intangible. I don't know if that makes sense? Like, if it's something that I can't quite understand and it's not pertaining per se to me, then I can't really make a good timeframe.  

**Okay.**  

**In your education before UofM, and I think you touched on this, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Well, yeah, I kind of talked about that. I wasn't exactly a strong student until my junior year and my senior year. So my senior year, I feel like I did a lot and, um, was very good. That year I was one of the top people when it came to Science Olympiad, was one of the top people when it came to, I guess, my classes. So yeah, that's when I was pretty excellent. But actually, beforehand, I was a pretty mediocre student. That's surprising, but yeah - I was pretty average and I'm pretty average still. I'm at a 3.82 GPA. Well, it's more like 3.80 when I think about it.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Yeah. I mean, that's kind of obvious considering the personal story I just told you, you know. <laugh>, But yeah, I definitely felt that way, and I still do at times. It's not great. I feel like there has very much been a push to try to do more, I guess, and not really consider your own satisfaction towards it. I do think that it's something that's been kind of an issue with me.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

Hmm. I accept it. I try to figure out what I could have done better, but I guess I know that there's not much else I can do to change that other than try to learn from it. That's what I'd say.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

A little awkwardly. I'd say I feel like...I dunno. Yeah, I see what you're saying. There's been a lot of times where if it's something that I really worked hard at, I feel appreciated whenever I get praise. If it's something that I guess wasn't really super important or was just almost like, an intuitive facet of myself? For example, if I'm really knowledgeable in this one class and the reason why I'm really knowledgeable is because I've done in my lab or I've am just interested in the general subject matter as a whole - so if I've been spending time to try to learn it and someone's praising me for that, then I'll say, "Well, okay, thanks for praising me, but that's just because I, you know, like it?" So that's where it gets a little awkward. But usually I'd say I'm pretty good with accepting it. It's just those instances - which actually, I guess, is a lot of the time. 'cause there's a lot of times that I think it's like, you know, small. Well, not small, but it's just something I'm interested in. So it's like, "Thanks, I know I work hard on it, but I mean, it's what I like to do". <laugh>  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

I feel really happy, duh! When I succeed, I'm like, "Yeah, I wanna do more!" It's good stuff.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I hope they're happy if they're people that like, you know, like me. I imagine that people that don't like me are pretty upset and just want me to fail, but yeah.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Burnout is the excessive push to try to accomplish something. Either it's a standard set by the person, whether it be a standard that's already set or a standard that they have set themselves - I guess one that's already set. I just said the same thing twice basically. To reiterate, burnout is the overexhaustion associated with pushing oneself to accomplish one's own set goal.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?** 

Yes. 

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Imposter syndrome is believing that you aren't worthy enough or aren't capable enough to be in the position that you are in.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yes.  

**Can you elaborate?**  

I mean, I already kind of told you, right? That personal story.  

**Have you experienced burnout in other instances?** 

Yes. I mentioned the other incident, but yes.  

**Outside of those two incidents?**  

Yes. It's an occasional thing. I shouldn't say occasional...I guess it happened more recently because of those previous burnout points, right? I've noticed there are these minor burnouts, like I recognize that I'm pushing myself a little too hard and I know that I have to just back off. That's why I take a little more time off for the weekends. But yeah, they're still classified as burnout times  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yes.  

**Could you elaborate?**

Now. Right now, if I'm being honest, I feel like, I feel like...I feel like I don't really qualify enough right now to try to work on things that I'm working on, because I just don't have that creativity and understanding. I know it's just something I have to just read more about, but it is a little rough to start off and realize, "Oh, I actually don't know anything". That's where the imposter syndrome comes in. Beforehand, in UMich? Not really. It's just now, really, of all times.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**

In UMich?... 30% to 40% of students I've noticed.  

**Could you elaborate?**  

I guess whenever I go into class and I interact with people there, I can notice that some people are really tired or people are all like, complaining a lot, more so than usual. It's not like the "Ha ha I complain" where you look at and say "These are just minor problems". They're complaining because they are tired. So I guess that's a social, like, knowing. So I'd say 30% to 40%.  

**Okay. How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

That's a little hard to qualify. People don't like to talk about it, which is what I noticed. I would say...it's really hard, because I can't really tell that that's a problem. With tiredness you can tell, because they act it. Imposter syndrome, unless they're a little more anxious - I guess they're more anxious than usual. But even then, that's really hard to tell sometimes. And oftentimes, I guess I'm in a position where I work myself where I can't really notice that sometimes. I do try my best. But yeah, I'd say again, 30% to 40%.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Awareness? Definitely hindered. There's no doubt, because you have to interact with other people in order to understand when someone's going through either of these things. So yeah, COVID definitely hindered that. What was the second question?  

**How has it affected your experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Imposter syndrome and burnout...I feel like it hasn't. It's a little bit of a weird thing - this is my own case, but it personally helped because actually, I didn't have to interact with other people? So then you could kind of self-delude yourself into thinking that you're better than you are. <laugh> It's a little funny when I say that, but it's...yeah. The thing is, with COVID, since most things are online, the classes tended to be easier. So that means that with online classes, you just didn't have to work as hard, and so that actually freed up more time. So yeah, it helped.  

**We're close to wrapping up here. Considering everything we've talked about today, do you and have you enjoyed your academic work?**  

Academic work? Yes, I have enjoyed all of it. I somewhat regret my lab work because of the reason I mentioned before, but other than that, I don't regret anything.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Um...sorry, I'm just thinking about it. Moderately? There's not much else to say about that.

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Take time to do the things that satisfy you. The reason why I say that is because, uh, there's this point in time where working can be really satisfying, and then after working so hard, you realize it isn't very satisfying anymore. So then you move on to play. And after you play a bit, you realize you're not very satisfied with that, so then you go back to work. That's what I'd say.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Nope, I don't think so.  

**Alright, that concludes things. Thank you for participating and I will stop the recording here.**
