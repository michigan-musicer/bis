**Okay, to warm up a little bit, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Um, I guess I'm a little confused on how to answer that. Um, what...I guess it might defeat the purpose to ask what you're looking for. But, um I went to a normal public K12 public school system. Um, yeah, I went to elementary originally in New York. I wasn't able to complete that because I moved to Michigan during that. I completed my elementary school in Michigan, and I also did middle school and high school in Michigan. 

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Peers...probably a couple hundred, at least? 

**Couple hundred is pretty large. Just curious how you're getting that?**  

Um, I'm mostly getting that just from the average EECS class, basically. Yeah. That's how I'm getting it.  

**Okay. So out of these peers, how many people would you be able to talk to about work or class, et cetera?**  

Oh, that's what you mean? Uh, maybe a dozen in that case, people I can confide in and stuff like that.   

**Okay.**

**How many years have you been in your major?**  

I've been in my major for three years.  

**What's the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Um, let's see. I've always been into technology, and taking a computer programming class back in high school made me think, "Oh, I enjoy doing this". So I continued pursuing it in college.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

I want to say I don't really have one? No, I can think of instances, but I wouldn't really call them stories or anything like that.  

**If you can just give one example of an instance, that's perfectly fine.**  

Well...actually, does it have to be positive or negative?  

**It can be whatever.**  

Alright, taking EECS 203. I remember just trying to figure out the group homework with my partner, and we just didn't know how to do most of it. So I remember agonizing on many nights over that. At one point they dropped the class, and I had to fend for myself. That was memorable.  

**Alright. What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in an average semester?**  

Mm. Most recently, maybe 30 hours. It's like a range of 25 to 30 hours.  

**And what's the average number of rest hours you get in an average week in an average semester?**

Not including sleep...this is including weekends? I'd say 25 or 31.  

**What is the average number of hours worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Probably more around 30 hours.  

**And for that semester, what was the average number of rest hours you got per week?**  

Probably more like 20. 

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

...35.  

**Okay. Can you walk me through that or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Uh, sure. This was the most recent semester. Um, I was taking EECS 485 and usually the week leading up to the deadline, which usually falls on a Sunday, my team would spend a lot of hours just trying to get that out. So we would...what is it? I forgot what it's called. Basically we would use some kind of scheduler to schedule times that we could meet up, or if not possible, we would assign different parts of the project to one another, update each other on what the progress is, and basically whenever during we were free that week, we would just put in hours on the project.  

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?** 

During the school semester, a moderate amount.  

**Okay, can you elaborate on that?**  

Um, let's see. In terms of attending lectures, I would tend to keep myself up to speed, you know, always attend those lectures. So I mean, that's like a static thing. That's something that's always gonna happen. In terms of working and rest hours, those are usually more flexible. I usually find myself being able to change that as I need. Even when I was working on the project, if I really needed a break or something, I would take that break and let my group members know. 

**Okay.**  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yes.  

**How so?**  

Compared to high school, a lot of the classes, especially in EECS, are a lot more project-based; and that usually involves pumping out some kind of thing every couple of weeks or so, which is even more the case going into higher level EECS classes. Generally in my mind, the term "project" has a negative connotation, and also generally it takes me a bit to get into the rhythm of actually doing it. Like once I start a project, usually it starts rolling out, but the main thing is actually getting started. So just taking a lot of these project-based classes, sort of gets at my enthusiasm. Another factor is, um, you know - in college, especially at UofM, a lot of it is on you in terms of learning material or doing any other stuff. Even if you don't understand something, you have to personally decide to do office hours or reach out.

Yeah, a lot of it's more on you, and it took me longer than I should have to adapt to that. But those are separate factors.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Yes.  

**How so?**  

Uh, I'm not sure if this is an age thing or just a doing-a-lot-of-college-for-a-long-time thing. But I do find myself having less energy overall to...just overall, yeah, less energy to do stuff. That's also on both a physical and mental level.  

**Okay. Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Yes. Um, let's see. So freshman year, I found myself struggling with classes and...okay. Usually when I struggled back in high school, I could somehow, with some effort, get my grade or my situation back to normal. Like I could usually fish out a B or A. But in college I found that didn't work - specifically I'm thinking of physics, physics and calculus.

Those two were pretty, like...they require you to put hours in. So taking those sort of put my grade down, and then sophomore year, it was a continuation of that mindset where I keep doing what I was doing back in high school in college; but also, sophomore year was mostly a COVID year. So we were mostly virtual. I don't think that really helped, because I found it a lot harder to ask questions or find the opportunity to ask questions. Usually in person, I could just stay behind if needed. But online, it was a little harder to do that, plus it was harder to motivate myself to care. Junior year I started trying to get back into it, getting my grades back up, and I did. 

But overall, I think my grades - well, my overall academic results have been a lot worse compared to before college.  

**When you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

I do find myself making those a little too broad, so - because the goals are so broad, it's hard to find concrete steps to take towards doing anything like that. Recently I've been trying to make goals more specific and short-term. I starting doing whiteboarding and just writing down minute tasks. So I think that's a step towards better setting and achieving goals.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yes.  

**How so?**  

This is before UofM, right? Usually I found myself, even with subjects I wasn't necessarily good in - I'll usually be able to get an A out somehow. Even in my class, I was in the top 20 at least. So I felt that I always did good before UofM.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

I guess in the sense of...yes. In the sense that sometimes, it feels like the expectation is to have a certain base level skillset and experience that I feel like I don't necessarily meet. If that makes sense. 

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

Um, something I've come to become too used to, too accepting of. Um, may I elaborate? I found that my mindset back in high school was...I guess I never really considered failure a possible outcome that I thought of too much. Even if I thought of it, usually it's like, "Oh, it turned out okay, oh good". 

Once I hit college at UofM - again, I experienced a few failures back in freshman year. I sort of waved it off initially at the time, because like, "Oh, it's okay, I'll just make up for it later, because I've always been a strong student". But it just kept happening more and more, and I found myself seeing those failures as - instead of seeing failure as something I should avoid, it was more like...I basically gained the same attitude towards failure as the attitude I had towards success back in high school. So it's sort of expected, I gained that same similar attitude towards failure. Yeah.

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Uh, I usually think of it as flattery, um, in the sense that...well, hold on, is that in general or is that specific to my time at UofM? Uh...I don't think my answer would change regardless, so I'm gonna continue answering. Yeah, scratch that.

I'll give you two different responses. Back in high school, I did feel like I was doing really well academically compared to my peers. But still in the case of high school, whenever someone would praise me for that...it depends on the person. Sometimes I take it as is. I take it honestly, "Oh thanks", gratitude. But sometimes, it does feel like they're sort of mocking me. 

Then at UofM, I would say it doesn't mean as much. Because it feels like I can always do better, and it doesn't feel like there's much to be praised for in reality. So I guess at UofM, it doesn't feel like I really have much to be, like - thinking about myself - I don't feel like I have much to be academically praised for. So if I do anything like that, I usually don't necessarily see it as...what's the word?  I can't really word it well right now. So what I'm gonna say is it's sort of like, um...courtesy. Yeah, just common courtesy so it doesn't really mean anything extraordinary. 

**Okay. What feelings do you have when you succeed?** 

I feel happy of course. Um, yeah, I guess that's about it. 

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I find that they're usually happy for me, especially if they've seen me work on whatever it is and they're happy to see that it paid off.

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Um, let's see...I usually think of it as when a person has been doing something, in a broad sense, and they've just been doing it for a long time and they've just worn out either mentally or physically or both.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

I guess impulse syndrome is the feeling of...that you don't belong, even though that might not be the case, due to feeling inferior in some sort of way compared to peers.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah.  

**Can you describe some of those experiences?**  

Um, burnout...I can't think of anything at the moment. 

**Do you believe you ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah.  

**Could you describe some of your experiences with imposter syndrome?**  

Sure. Say I'm working on the project with group members. I usually sort of get the feeling that other people pick up on new stuff faster than I am. And when I see them just coding away at something and I just don't understand what's going on, it feels like...yeah, I feel sort of like an imposter. Like I'm just sort of tagging along just for the grade. I guess overall, I just feel like I am less competent overall given the same time as my peers.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

Extremely.  

**Could you elaborate on that?**  

Um, just talking to peers, be it of the same major or not, it seems like everyone's always stressing about something. In the case of computer science students, I hear all too often, like, "Yeah, I just need to take a break, something along the lines of that, when they sort of...like, you know, burnout was a common thing, and due to COVID, people were taking steps seemingly to address it.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

Moderately? I find that most people I see tend to be confident in what they're doing, and they don't seem or feel like they feel like an imposter. At the same time, it might just be me selectively noticing. Because of that, I feel like there might be more than I think there is, if that makes sense.  

Like personally I feel like most of the peers around me, they usually seem pretty confident in what they're doing. They don't seem like they're experiencing any imposter syndrome, but taking into account that it might just be me selectively noticing because I feel like an imposter and I'm just looking for things that sort of affirm what I think - I feel like there's probably actually more people experiencing that than I think there are.  

**Okay. How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**   

In terms of awareness...I don't think my awareness has changed. I think I was always aware of that since freshman year, so even before COVID. What COVID did do was amplify my experience with them. Okay, I think this might have contributed to why I couldn't answer burnout, because I think I have a little trouble defining what I experienced as burnout now. 'cause usually I lack so much motivation in the first place that I'm not sure if I can experience burnout. I'm not sure if that makes sense. 

But in terms of imposter syndrome, it does feel like I didn't make use of my time nearly as well as people who were able to adapt to doing things during the global pandemic. They made the use of the time a lot better, and I should have. So I think that amplified that, yes.  

**Okay.**  

**Alright, we're close to wrapping up here, just a few more questions. So considering everything that we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Um...I think overall, yes, even taking into account everything. Especially as I get into more higher-level courses that I focus on more niche stuff, I find they're usually more interesting, and it just feels more relevant and professors seem to be a little more passionate about these niche topics. So it feels easier to ask them and...yeah. I think I overall still found myself enjoying what I'm learning, and I don't think I could necessarily enjoy stuff besides what I'm doing right now.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Not really. Not really at all.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Um, let's see...regarding burnout, set a schedule and pace yourself. Scheduling is really important. Just having some sort of plan can help a lot. In terms of imposter syndrome, it's better to reach out for help than not at all, so if you have questions, go ask. Peers, you know, they're there. Ask questions, collaborate, get to know people. I think that probably could have helped a lot with that. Yeah.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say?**

Not really.

**Okay. Thank you for participating.**
