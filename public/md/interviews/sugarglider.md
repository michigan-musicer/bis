**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

So I lived in Michigan my whole life and I went to normal elementary, middle school, high school. Um, yeah. What kind of stories are you interested in, just generally how was it? Or anything specific?  

**I suppose I'm most interested in how your prior education affected how things went at college.**  

Sure, yeah, that transition. So high school, I definitely felt like I didn't have to work as hard as I did in college. I didn't spend a lot of time studying, and I don't think I developed very good study habits; but it kind of was okay for that time period. So the first semester of college was definitely a shock. But you know, once I realized I have to put in extra effort studying and it's more about caring about what I'm learning rather than, you know, comparing myself to others and being like the best in the class - that's really what helped me kind of adjust.

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

So peers, I would say probably around a hundred people. Like in computer science, there's people that I recognize in classes, who I'm not necessarily close with, but I feel like I could talk, go up to in class, or just collaborate with in the area. Yeah.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your major?**  

Four.  

**What was the story of you deciding on your major?**  

So in high school, I took AP comp sci and I really loved it. I also was kind of moved by the fact that there weren't too many girls in the class, so I think that was probably also a motivating factor for me wanting to go into this field. And you know, I liked it! I thought it was pretty good. So I wanted to hopefully be that role model for somebody in the future, but I also just really enjoyed the logic of it - the problem solving - and I also really enjoyed the flexibility. 'cause I feel like I have a hard time deciding exactly what I wanna do; philosophy's also very open-ended, so I like that too. So I feel like I was going a bunch of different directions, but computer science let me explore a lot of different things, and I don't feel too locked into doing one specific type of work.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Let's see. I would say taking 445, honestly. It was over Zoom, but I felt like the professor did a really good job, still trying to connect with students and just hanging out on the Zoom for a few minutes after class talking with her and seeing how interested she was in the questions people had. I tried to do a side project on my own, and she was really helpful in answering my questions and giving me advice about that. So I felt like it was a professor that really cared and really wanted me to succeed, which was nice.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per a week in an average semester?**  

So on schoolwork, I probably did maybe 20 hours a week, 15 to 20. And then "work" work, I would do maybe 10 to 15 hours a week.  

**Just checking, does "work" work mean working for a company?**  

Yeah, so I did a few different types of work to make money. So I was either doing a co-op or being an IA or working in the math lab or something like that. Yeah.  

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester? When I say waking rest, I mean time you take off during the day.**  

I think I got better - initially in freshman year, it was maybe one to two hours a day. I felt like I didn't have a great balance starting off, but it definitely got better towards junior, senior year. I'd say I save maybe two to three hours a day, maybe, and then on weekends I was a lot better about managing my time. So I'd only work on the weekends if I had to, which was good.  

**Okay. What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**.  

Freshman year I probably worked 20 to 30 hours a week, so probably that - just trying to get used to the classes.

**And for that semester, what was the average number of rest hours you got per week? Although I think you kind of answered that already.**  

Yeah, maybe one hour a week? Well, not a week, but I don't know, five hours a week of rest.  

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

It's really hard to say. <laugh> Probably...I guess a full time job's 40 hours. I feel like it's probably, I don't know, 45, 50, maybe? There were definitely weeks where I felt like I was on the whole week, from early in the morning to past five or six. So maybe I'd say 45 or 50, maybe.  

**Can you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**  

So let's see...I'd say junior year second semester, I was doing a remote job that I was trying to put 10 hours a week into. I was also an IA, and I was helping out a little bit on a research project I was previously involved in. Those kind of extracurricular things took up a lot of my time. I think that week, they were trying to publish a paper for that previous research I was in, so they needed me to help out with running some stuff. So that took up time, and then classes were going on that week, and then I was also making sure I hit my 10 hours for my other remote job, and you know, same with IA, making sure homework's ready and out on time, discussion notes, things like that.  

So I remember I'd have my one laptop for my remote job and then my laptop for school, and I remember just switching between the two, literally going from one screen to the other because everything was remote. So I'm in my apartment all day sitting on my couch. I remember not taking the time to make decent meals, so I had some snacks here or there. And I remember finally at the end of the night DoorDash-ing McDonald's, so happy to be done with it all. But yeah, I think that the pattern was really just sitting in my apartment all day, going from one laptop to the other, and not prioritizing my food, which I should've.

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

Now, I feel like I have a lot more control over it. I'd say early on in my college career, I wanted to do everything, and I feel like I probably took on more than I should have those years. But now I really think it's important to have a work-life balance, and so I feel like I have better organization now. I keep a better detailed to-do list, and I set out specific goals so I don't feel like I have like a massive open-ended amount of work to do each day. And I keep a calendar now, which is helpful. And now I schedule when I'm doing something else that's not work - I make sure I'm doing that. So I feel like it's gotten a lot better, and I definitely try to manage that a lot more.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, I did. I think I came in with the mindset of "Oh, I'm good at math, I know what to do", things like that. And I was like, "I'll just do it, it's just more classes to take". But then I realized it's really not about just doing well, you should do something you're interested in. So I took the minds and machines philosophy class, and I really liked that, and I took a math class I really liked. And as my college career went on, I was very intentional about all the classes that I chose. Then getting involved in different research projects, I knew which ones were not for me and what I didn't wanna do in the future. And then I've been working with an EECS professor, and that spoke a lot more to my interest. So I felt like I've become more intentional about what I wanna do in the future and what I choose to spend my time on.

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Hmmm...so I guess I came in very enthusiastic, which maybe made the workload - well, I was able to handle it. I think I've just changed what I want to put my energy towards. I feel like I have the same amount of energy from the beginning, but I think I'm just spending it in different ways. So I had a lot more energy for working when I first came to UofM, but now I put a decent amount of energy into work, but also save more for free time - like socializing, doing different hobbies and things that I enjoy. So I don't feel like I'm too tired at the end of college, but I feel like I've just reapportioned where I put my energy.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, I think they've gotten better. <laugh> I had some rough tests and stuff early on, which made me kick into gear mentally that it wasn't gonna be the same as high school. I learned, uh, definitely better study habits. I learned, you know, that when I was taking the classes that I enjoyed more, it felt easier to study for them and actually get into the content. So yeah, definitely better as time went on.  

**When you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Let's see. I think I don't set a ton of short term...I mean, I'll set day to day goals about what I wanna get done, and I think sometimes I overestimate how much I can do in a day. That's something I wanna get better at so I'm not disappointed by the end of the day. Like I'll have a certain set of tasks and I'll try to get them all done in one day, and I'll be like "Okay, whatever, the next day I'll just finish whatever I have then". But I think it's better to split it up so I don't feel like I've somehow not done enough one day. Long term goals I'm better about, but I think it's the day-to-day goals that, um, I'll think I can do much more in a day than I actually can.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yeah, I think I was. I felt like I took a lot of AP classes and different things, so I do feel like I did well in high school and stuff.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Not really at UofM, I think it was more in high school. Even back to elementary school, I'd do the mad minutes or whatever really fast, and so I'd feel, like, this pressure - people knew me as the smart kid, and I felt a lot of pressure throughout high school to keep that up. So I think the first semester at UofM, I was used to being known as that person, and then I very quickly realized that's pretty much everybody at UofM. They were all the smart kid, and now we're all here together, just doing our best. And so it's not worth trying to compete and go for some title of being the best academically. It was much more important to just figure out my own path and figure out what I like to do. So I would say that...I don't know if I felt the pressure too much to do it all at UofM. Maybe a little bit in like, I should try to do research and do hard classes. But I didn't feel overwhelmed in college like maybe I did earlier.   

**Okay.**

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

It definitely still is something I struggle with. When applying to grad school, I applied to 11 schools and got rejected for most of them, and that was really hard for me to come to terms with. Even though I'm really happy with what I'm doing here, it still felt like, you know, it's not enough. And I definitely questioned, you know, did I do something wrong? Maybe I don't deserve this other thing I did get. So yeah, I think I definitely struggle with it. I know it's an important part of life, and I've meta-analyzed it and I know it's good for me, and I know that in the long run I'll be happy that I've experienced it. But sometimes short-term, my initial thoughts are, I think, too negative towards it.   

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I definitely enjoy it. I feel uncomfortable, you know, if it's in a setting where I don't wanna feel singled out. But if it's something that I know I worked hard on and I'm proud that I did, then I feel more like, "Oh, it's nice to hear that". But if it's just like a test result or something, I don't wanna feel like my grade is singled out over others.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

I feel very proud. I feel kind of lighter, like something that I had been working towards worked out. Um, it feels very comfortable. It's just a good feeling. It feels like, you know, things worked out and I actually worked for them.

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I generally have pretty positive experiences. I have a lot of good friends, and they're always very happy for me when something works out. My boyfriend is also very supportive and stuff like that, so for me, my support group has been pretty positive.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Burnout I would say is when you start prioritizing work over other basic needs and you start getting lower sleep quality, not enough nutrients, not enough exercise. And you start to just feel very pulled in different directions, and, I don't know, when it starts taking a toll on your body, when you haven't been prioritizing the things that you need to take care of yourself.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Imposter syndrome to me is, uh, feeling like you don't belong somewhere that you do belong. No matter what credentials you may have to get yourself there, you can always justify that you shouldn't be doing what you're doing and people think that you don't belong where you belong, and that they're just kind of pretending that you do belong there.   

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah, I would say so. Not long term, but I think on some of those weeks, especially that second semester junior year when I was doing a lot of extracurriculars, there were frequent times that I would feel burned out. But that was definitely a big reason why I wanted to have a better work-life balance and be more intentional about only doing things I really wanted to work on.   

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah, I have, even recently. They've been teaching us about imposter syndrome since freshman year; that comes up in different classes, you're aware of it, and you know, it's not really a thing that you need to be worrying about. But even this summer, I'm meeting with my advisor for next year. We're just doing some reading together, literally just for my own benefit to catch up with what he's been reading so we can be on the same page when the semester starts. But I still feel like when he asked me a question, if I don't have the right answer, even though it's just a purely educational learning experience, then, you know, my initial thought is that he's thinking that he picked the wrong person for his student. Like he doesn't actually wanna work with me. So I think my initial thoughts are still in that phase sometimes, which is something I need to work on.   

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I think it's pretty high. I think Michigan is a very work-hard play-hard school, so I think it's hard for people to find the right balance, whether they're burned out from trying to socialize while also doing work or just taking on too many things. And the fact that Michigan is so big and there's so many resources and so many things to do, you can feel like you wanna try it all and then get burned out very easily.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is along your peers?**  

I think it's probably pretty prevalent, I would say maybe more so in underrepresented communities - I'm thinking about computer science in general. So I do feel like I see a fair amount of people who are very confident in the work they do. That doesn't necessarily mean that they don't have imposter syndrome, but there's definitely a majority that presents as, um, feeling very comfortable in the field that they're in. But I would imagine imposter syndrome is still pretty prevalent.

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

So I think working remotely, it was a lot easier to take on more things and feel like you need to work more, in terms of burnout. Especially when - like I lived in a studio that year, so my bedroom was my living room, and so the place I sleep and relax is the same as the place I work. And I felt like I didn't have a good separation between the two, so it was hard to know when to stop. Like if my laptop was open, I felt like I should be working, not watching TV or relaxing or doing something else. 

In terms of imposter syndrome...yeah, I could imagine that it made it worse as well. If you're not connecting with people more and hearing their thought process - when you work on homework with other people in-person, you get to see them work through the problem, try to do problem solving; you get to see them fail. But you know, you guys work together, you eventually get it, and so that kind of helps with seeing other people also have to struggle to get something done. But when you're on your own, you end up doing a lot more of the work individually or on Zoom with your cameras off, where you can't see how the other person is reacting. So maybe you feel like other people are getting it without having to struggle or work, when that's probably, obviously not the case.  

**Okay. Close to wrapping up: considering everything that we've talked about today, do you and have you enjoyed your academic work?**  

Yeah, I do. I think that initially - I think I've mentioned a few times, I think my goals for learning changed, and now I really enjoy what I'm doing and I feel like I've been able to find something that combines my interests pretty well. I think the key was being intentional about the things that I wanted to learn and not necessarily just doing things for the sake of having hard classes on my transcript or having certain things on my resume to make it look better. So I think yeah, I feel like I've really enjoyed my time, and it's gotten better each year.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Oh, I don't think I knew about it at all in high school. In high school, I never felt like I was overwhelmed by work, so I guess I didn't really think about the concept too much. And then imposter syndrome, I probably didn't know what the name for it was. I definitely hadn't heard of the name, and I don't know if I thought about it as much. I think the closest that I got to it was just recognizing, you know, there weren't as many girls in this class or whatever. But that honestly always made me feel like I wanted to prove people wrong. That was kind of my attitude in high school.

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I would say your freshman year, focus more on expanding your social network. I feel like I have a really good support group now, but I don't think I prioritized meeting a lot of new people. I had a couple close friends, but having a big group of people from different backgrounds, it's always really nice to hear what they're working on, their thoughts, and uh, if you're ever feeling a certain way, you have people to talk to about it. I think that that's another thing, is being able to vocalize the feelings that I was having. I think I was definitely more of a...I mean, I like keeping things to myself, feeling like I can work through my emotions on my own and get it all figured out. But it's so much nicer to find people you trust to be able to talk it out with them. So yeah, I think the most important thing would be focusing more on socialization the first year, first semester to second semester.  

**Anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

So I guess if the purpose of this is to have other people read these stories, maybe something important I'd want other people to know is: imposter syndrome can probably present very differently. People that come across as being successful in what they do, being confident and seeming like they have it together - they may be experiencing the same thing that you are. And don't assume anybody else's thoughts about your aptitude for what you're doing. If you have questions, ask them. Nobody's really gonna judge you that much for asking questions. So I think, yeah, try to not think too much about what other people think of you. Maybe that's obvious, but I think it's just nice to hear that. That's all.

**Great, thank you. I will stop the recording here.**
