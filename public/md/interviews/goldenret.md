**Alright, as a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Prior going to UofM, I studied four years at a high school in Michigan. I was generally speaking a pretty highly motivated guy. I had set one goal for myself through pretty much all of school before getting to college, and that was to go to Michigan. So I loaded up on as many extracurriculars as I could, took all the hardest classes that I thought were reasonable, and basically studied all the damn time and just worked my way into it, and then did eventually get in. Yeah, I was a pretty solid student in high school.  

**Approximately how many people did you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Yeah. <laugh> So this might be a large number, but I was in the glee club at UofM, and there's a hundred guys in that group. I would consider at least every one of them to be a peer of mine, 'cause I spent a large chunk of time with them, we all had similar interests, there were a couple of us that were studying similar things...so at least them. Then some people in - man, this is gonna sound kind of dorky, but the acapella community. I invested a lot of time into that as an extracurricular as well; I dated some people from that scene and hung out with a lot of people there. I would consider them peers as well. And then of course my classmates, especially so in the film program. Less so in communications because the department was so much bigger.  

But in the film program, uh, everybody settles into a certain track eventually, whether it's writing, production, editing, what have you. I settled into the writing track, and my senior year class had eight people in it. So it became a pretty...tight-knit probably isn't the correct description because, you know, we didn't hang out outside of class a ton; but you know, I would absolutely consider them my peers, as I gave them advice on what they were writing, asked them for help for mine, stuff like that.  

**Sorry if I missed this: did you have an approximate count on the number of peers that you had?**  

Yeah, I'd say probably somewhere around 150.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your majors?**  

Communications I picked up my sophomore year, so three. I was in film all four years.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your majors?**  

Film I knew I wanted to do from jump. I've always been a pretty creative guy, I grew up making movies in the backyard of my friend's house - just, you know, with a shitty old camcorder that probably weighed 10 pounds. 

So I knew I wanted to do that when I got to school, but initially I was gonna do political science. I transferred out of that into communications after I realized I didn't really...I didn't quite have the love for it that I thought I did. Also, the workload was a lot. I think it was perhaps made a little bit worse by the fact that the professor I had for my early level classes, well, it was his first time teaching at Michigan. I think he just hadn't quite figured out the rhythm of what people were going to be able to dedicate on a class-by-class basis, given the schedules that we all had. So I did transfer out of that, and then found I enjoyed communications much more and found that it also played off of my film degree pretty well as well. 'cause you know, film is the study of making media, and then communications was the study of how that media affects society and how it affects people and stuff like that. So I figured it was a pretty good tandem to have.  

**Okay. What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

<laugh> This is my junior year: I was in a class that I really quite enjoyed, uh, about long form journalism. This was after I had left political science and before I had settled on communications. I knew I loved to write, so I was taking a bunch of different types of writing styles to see which one I'd settle on, and I had a draft due the next morning that was, uh...I think it was supposed to be around 12 to 15 pages, and I had gotten about six pages into my first draft, on my first subject, and decided that I hated it. So I went to the UGLI the night after - I should preface that I was on a bus coming back from Ohio with the glee club, because we had a performance that day.  

So we got back to Ann Arbor at midnight, and I went straight to the UGLI, and this was the same night that Michigan was playing in March Madness to go to the final four. So, you know, you start off the night, there's probably six or seven people in the UGLI, and I snagged one of those window rooms that everybody wants to get into but are never available during the day. So I was working, working, plugging away, plugging away, plugging away, and every now and again, I'd look up and - all those windows are lined up, so you can see everybody who's in the room across from you, everybody who's behind you, right? Finally, one time I look up and there's nobody in front of me anymore, and I'm like, "That's weird". And I turn around, there's nobody behind me anymore. "That's even weirder!" And so I walk out into the second floor of the UGLI and do a scan and I am the only person in the library. <laugh> This was probably 4:30 AM, I wanna say. I got the draft done and it was pretty good, but I think it was 4:30 AM, I was the only dude in the UGLI, and I kept working till about 5:00 AM.   

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester? Whatever you would consider work.**  

Solely on academics, if we're counting classes, I think I never really took less than 14 credit hours. My freshman year I took 16 first semester, 18 second. The second semester my senior year got weird because of COVID, but...at least 14 hours from just lecture, and you could probably tack on another 20 for general homework and studying. So probably say 35 just for that. And then the extracurriculars I was in got pretty intense. Glee club was three and a half hours a week, but even more than that, the acapella group I was in, that was four hours a week in rehearsals. Usually we'd have one to two gigs a week, which were usually at least one to two hour commitments, and then you'd have to work on your own, probably for another hour a day. 

So if you got 35 from academics, well, round up to four for glee club, another four for acapella rehearsal, that puts us at 43. Uh, four hours for two gigs, two hour commitment each, 47. Then rehearsal...I'd say 50 hours of just work time, probably, and that's an average week. If it's exams or I got a project coming up - for film especially, because we had exams obviously, but we'd have projects a lot. Then you could crank that up to the 60 to 70 range.

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week? When I say waking rest, I mean time that you take off during the day.**  

Oh, I thought you meant just pure sleep, 'cause like, fucking none of it. 

**Oh dear.**

Waking rest, hard to say. I mean, if I'm in class for four hours a day, then...I don't know, probably throw in one hour for lunch, one hour for dinner, couple hours scattered throughout the day. Probably somewhere like five or six. I'm probably lowballing that, but thinking back on it, probably somewhere around five or six.  

**Okay. Now that you mentioned it, I'm curious about sleep as well.**  

Yeah. I've always had trouble sleeping. I usually fall asleep around 2:00 AM, 2:30 AM on an average night. So you know, if I was falling asleep then, which would be if I'm not working, waking up probably or somewhere around 10:00 AM. Maybe earlier, depending on if I have class or if I gotta get stuff done. So anywhere from six to seven hours, I'd say.  

**You alluded to this already, but what is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Oh yeah. That would've been probably the first semester of my junior year. I had just gotten into that acapella group, and it became apparent that I was gonna have to work really fucking hard to reach the skill level of the guys that I'd walked into. I was taking most of my final film classes then, 'cause I knew I needed to catch up on some comm stuff.  

Also, my uncle died, totally unexpectedly, and a lot of my bandwidth was just...you know, grief. It doesn't really have a specific "time" necessarily, but everything just gets harder when you feel like shit, you know? I'd say probably somewhere around 60 to 70 hours, probably capping out at 70, maybe plus that, honestly, when it was really bad. Both because my workload increased from what it was in years previous, but also because everything that would've taken me a shorter amount of time in previous years just took me longer. 'cause when you're dealing with something that's that heavy, it saps your energy to do anything, to do everything, even the things that you love. Because you wake up and you just have this weight, you know? So yeah, I'd say probably 70 hours. My worst period was at the beginning of that semester.  

**And for that semester, what is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week?**  

So I had a 9:00 AM three days a week that semester, and I was falling asleep probably around 4:00 AM. I would say that one you could ballpark between five to seven, probably closer to five. I did not sleep much those couple of weeks.  

**And how about rest during the day?**  

That one's tough to pin down. Like I said, with the grief thing, you kind of just find yourself staring into space thinking. I wouldn't really call that rest though. It also happens a lot of the time when you're supposed to be doing something else, so the time that you would spend doing normal shit, you're just like, "Fuck, I put this off, I gotta go do that". Probably...if my other one was five to six? It's probably three to four.

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

So early in that semester, I had a project for that 9:00 AM, which was a documentary filmmaking class. We had a shortform project that was due at the end of that week that I just hadn't gotten started, and I decided I wanted to make it about my uncle. I mean, I had seven days to work on it. I put an insane amount of work into that thing, man. The night before it was due at 9:00 AM, I was in my kitchen at 5:00 AM making last-minute edits. <laugh> I'd say I put 80 hours of work into that, that week. That was kind of my peak. After that happened, it kind of helped me get rid of some of the..."get rid of" is the wrong feeling, but just process some of the grief of what was going on. And I started sleeping better and I started keeping better hours in general. 

Something I do want to say - I don't know if it'll come up later, so I wanna make a note of it now - my professor for that documentary class bailed me out *so* hard. Like...There's lots of burnout that happens at UMich, and I feel like lots of times, faculty are either kind of insulated from it or view it as a, you know, crucible-type thing - which can be true to a certain extent. But I showed up late for that class so many times, just because I couldn't sleep 'cause my mind was running, and my professor was like, "So here's what your grade should be based on the amount of lates you had, but you and I both know there's some extenuating circumstances here, so here's what your grade's actually gonna be based on the work you did". So I mean, if like you said, this is going up as a resource for people who find themselves getting burned out...that wouldn't have happened if I hadn't made my project about the thing that was affecting me so heavily at the time. Just know that if you can talk to your professors about it, you might find that they're a bit more compassionate than the average bear. 

But yeah, I'd say 80 hours was my peak. After I hit that, I told myself, "Alright, I gotta recalculate, reevaluate some things here".   

**How much control did you feel you had over how you spend your time?**  

Weirdly I felt like I had a decent chunk of agency over what I was doing. I've always been the dude that's going to pick the hard stuff, for better or for worse, so I felt like I had a decent amount of control over what was going on. It just did feel like it was a lot, a lot of the time. You know, I could have dropped any number of the extracurriculars I was taking; I just saw and felt a lot of value in doing them. So I didn't, even if it, you know, made my schedule a little crazy.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah. So I don't know if COVID's kind of a confounding variable for this, but by the time I hit second semester senior year, I was like, "None of this fucking matters". <laugh> I had a bunch of job interviews lined up in Chicago, which is where I really wanted to go after I graduated, and all those got rescinded once COVID happened. I got dumped right before COVID and then immediately had to go stand alone and - well, not alone, but just stay inside in my apartment for three months. So yeah, I really did not care about doing my last couple assignments before I graduated anymore. I'd say about halfway through school was when I started to really feel it though. Like, you know, everybody goes to Michigan with the knowledge that they're no longer gonna be the number one guy, right?  

You go from being a big fish in a small pond to a tiny fish in a giant fucking pond. So I had known, and so when my grades - I wasn't pulling a 4.0 anymore or anything like that, but I knew that was coming. It wasn't until my junior year when I started to kind of value...I valued my education and everything obviously, and that was my primary reason for being there. But I started to value the connections I was making with people a lot, and the experiences I was getting out of those. For glee club, for example, we would go on tour every year around a bunch of the places in the United States. And then my senior year, we were supposed to go to Chile, Argentina, and Peru. COVID kept that from happening.  

But in order to go on those tours, you have to invest a certain amount of time during the year to earn points, because they can't take everybody. I went my freshman year after really busting my ass to go, and it cost me - like, I skipped a few classes to make sure I got the volunteer hours. And I realized at the end of that, "Holy crap, this experience was one of the most fulfilling, fun, enjoyable things I've ever done in my entire life". I got to travel around the country with 50 of my closest friends making music!  

I might have gotten a B+ because I cut a few classes to make that happen for myself, but holy shit, that was so worth it! Once I realized that there was value to stuff outside of academics - not "I just don't want to be doing my work, so I'm gonna do this", but real fulfillment and you know, just good stuff - I started to place a little bit less of an emphasis on academics if it led to more experiences like that.   

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**

Yeah, big time. I would lay this more on the feet of COVID than I would of Michigan, but I think it's probably both. I started my own business after school and I'm a freelance filmmaker and musician, and all of that requires a certain level of self-starterness, right? It took me a long, long time, and honestly, I'm still working on it to go back to that motivation I had when I was younger to really push myself. I think at Michigan...Michigan's great because it whips your ass. I came out of Michigan with a knowledge of what it feels like to get absolutely dunked on by classes and work for an entire week and come out the other side and do it again. That gives you a certain amount of resilience, and it gives you a certain amount of toughness that I think you don't really find at other places that would also give you a great education.  

However, in order to get that, in order to make that realization that that's what you now have, you also have to fight through a lot of self-worth stuff. A lot of "I worked as hard as I could and it still didn't happen, I still couldn't make it happen for myself". That's tough, man. That really hurts your motivation. When you go into a class and you've studied your ass off for the last week, as hard as you possibly can, and the professor sets the exam in front of you and you look at the first question and you're thinking, "I have no idea what the hell this is talking about" - that's a tough feeling. Like you don't wanna study for the next exam. <laugh> Because you feel like you're just gonna be in the same spot regardless. I'm grateful for how much I got my ass kicked because I feel like I now have the perspective to recognize - if I could get through that, I can get through this. But for a while there, it really felt like it wasn't worth working towards because I wasn't gonna hit the benchmark.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

I actually trended upwards at UofM academically, which was cool. Um, I, uh, so I think I, I graduated high school with a 3.9, I wanna say? Maybe a 3.85 or something like that, I don't know. Obviously got into Michigan. And then I got a 2.8 my freshman year, which sucked because...I expected to be worse at school. I didn't expect to be *that* much worse at school. It got a little bit better my sophomore year.  

Then weirdly enough, after the whole junior year crazy work, after the "your hair's on fire while also trying to grieve" semester happened and I started to try to incorporate a bit more of a work-life balance thing, I got so much better at school. My goal was to get on the dean's list once when I was at UofM. I got a 3.3 first semester my junior year, a 3.5 - which was dean's list - my second semester junior year, a 3.9 my first semester senior year, and then obviously COVID screwed with it a little bit, but I got a 4.0 my last semester. And I would've gotten a 4.0 even without the, um, let you drop your worst grade thing. So that was pretty cool. It was a real life case study for work-life balance, right? I came in furiously, trying to make my way here, didn't figure it out, peaked my junior year, and then after that said "Now we need to come back a little bit, ease back on the throttle", and then had my best results yet.  

**Okay. Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

So that's kind of something I need to work on, setting more realistic goals for myself. I was really good at it in undergrad and I was really good at it in high school. In high school, I had one goal, and it was to go to Michigan. Everything else was a subset to that. I was the captain of the cross country team because it was going to help me to go to Michigan. I was a drum major in marching band because it was going to help me go to Michigan. When I got to Michigan, I didn't have as many clear-cut things, but I knew I wanted to be in that acapella group from day one, so I went and I did that. I knew I wanted to make dean's list, so I went and I did that. Post-college it's been a little tougher, just because COVID has made things a lot more nebulous in terms of how to define success and how to advance professionally, especially in the business owner self-starter world. But in college I was pretty solid at setting them and accomplishing them.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student? I think you kinda touched on this already again.**  

Yeah. I was really good at social studies, anything in the humanities - I was a really great writer. I took as basically as many history and government and politics-related AP classes as I could have possibly taken. I think I took three my senior year...no, I took international studies. International studies wasn't an AP, but I took APUSH [AP US History] and AP world [history], uh, I just took a bunch of social studies stuff. I was also a great musician. I was one of the leaders in the choir when I was there, I was the drum major in the marching band, you know. I didn't go on to pursue that academically obviously, but it was a big part of my extracurricular stuff. But yeah, I don't know if I was ever given a certificate and a foam finger that said "You're #1", but I was definitely up there for the humanities before UMich.

**Do you or did you ever feel pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Oh yeah. Doesn't everybody? <laugh> I feel like that's the gist. You go because that's the expectation you set for yourself, right?  

Like you don't go to Michigan if you're okay with being a middle manager somewhere, right? Not that there's anything wrong with that - if that's your jam, then that's your jam. But you go to Michigan 'cause you got ambition and because your whole life, you've had this idea of you wanna be the best at whatever you do. Of course, Michigan is probably your first real reality check that the amount of work it's gonna take to make that happen is kind of insane. But yeah, that story, my most memorable academic story, I think was one of those nights. I just performed, I just spent two hours on a stage in a tuxedo in the worst fitting shoes anyone's ever heard of - there are these fake plastic patent leather jobbies and you stand in them for more than an hour and the rims just start digging into your ankle -  

Um, I got on a bus and then drove two hours back from Ohio to Ann Arbor, and then had to sit down and spend five hours at midnight working on a paper when all my friends were getting drunk at a bar watching Michigan win a basketball game. That's one of those moments where you gotta just go somewhere and say "Yeah dude, if you want to be the person you said you're gonna be, you're gonna have some of these times where it doesn't make any sense that you're doing what you're doing, but just do it".  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

Whooee. So I'm getting better, but - and I think this is something that a lot of people at Michigan can relate to - I am hypercritical, when I fail, of myself. It's very much like a "This didn't work because you did this thing wrong, this thing wrong, this thing wrong, how can you expect to succeed if you mess these things up?" And you know, *sometimes* that is true. If I just didn't put enough work in, then I very much have the ability to look in the mirror and say, "You just didn't work hard enough. Go back to the drawing board. You can make this work." There are times when it sucks, man. This app I've been working on, we've been trying to launch it for so fucking long, but for one reason or another, there's always a reason why it doesn't. And there were a couple of weeks this year where I said "Alright, we're making the push, this week it's gonna happen". And I threw everything I had behind making it work.  

And it just didn't happen, whether it was because I missed a tiny detail or whether it was something that was completely out of my control. And it really messes with you. It is tough to know you did everything you could, and it's not that it wasn't enough, it's just that it didn't work. That's hard to accept, especially when you're in this culture at Michigan where it's just work, work, work, work, work, succeed. There's very much an air of "You are here because you are the best and the best work hard". And when the best work hard, they get it done, right?

**How did you react to academic praise from others?**  

That's a good question. Um, weirdly, right? Like it was never like, "Thank you. I did do a great job." It was always "Ah, but I missed this thing. Ah, but I missed this thing. Ah, I could have done this thing."  

I mean, perhaps that's because I'm in such a creative field as well. It's hard sometimes too, as some of my mentors have said, to let the ugly baby walk. You know, there's some things that are wrong with it, but there's still value in what you have and you need to just let it do its thing. And then you can come back and adjust. Or if it's a movie or something - there's always gonna be a jump cut that you notice that nobody else does, or a color correction thing that you fixed, but it didn't really quite fix it that nobody else is gonna see. But because you know what the original looks like, you're gonna see it. So it was never "Wow, that made me feel good, thank you". It was "Thank you, but also, this".  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

It's lit? I mean, I feel like a lot of times it's hard to recognize...bear with me here, I might sound a little strange. It's hard to recognize success while you're having it. Because you can get so caught up in the work - a prime example of this is when I was in my senior year in the acapella group. We rotated out six guys and brought back in six new guys, leaving three to kinda lead the charge a little bit and establish what this group was gonna be about moving forward. And I was one of those three, and it was a lot because I'd only been in the group for a year and I was expected to teach these six new guys "Hey, here's what this group is about, here's what we try to do". And for a long time, I felt like I failed those guys in a lot of ways. 

It wasn't until literally last week, like two weeks ago - this is now two, three years down the line. I was just hanging out with one of 'em 'cause I'm great friends with all of them. They were talking about how the culture of the group itself has changed so much from what it used to be, because it used to be a very insulated, clique-y, exclusionary, a little arrogant type of vibe. And he was saying, "Yeah, that was never us at all. And a lot of that came from you because you said, 'We are here to be elite musicians, we are here to also include people.'" I should mention my acapella group is a subset of the glee club, so there's a hundred guys in the club and there's only nine in the acapella group, and you can only get into the group if you're in the glee club. So that's where some of the exclusionary nature came in. And he was saying "Yeah, you really established that culture change. That year we had 40 people audition and...that feeling doesn't really exist anymore because of you and Owen and Kevin", the three guys that were still there. And it was kind of like, holy shit.   

I accomplished my main goal that year. My main goal was to turn it into this inclusive place that was fun to be, with people that were fun to be around . And I got so caught up in all the music and the technicality and all that, that for literal years after the fact, I was thinking "Man, I could have done so much better about these guys." That's a really long answer. I hope that makes sense.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**

Well, I would like to say they're happy for me, and I would think that's the case. I just pushed out my first song. I released a song for the first time four days ago, and I got a bunch of support from my friends, my family, my peers, um, Alice Cooper's guitarist, which was kind of cool? So I mean, that's a mild success. That's been something I've been planning on doing for years that I finally made happen, and it was just a bunch of "We're super proud of you, man. It's a great song. Well done." So yeah, I think just happy for me.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Kind of working so hard that you're at the end of the rope and you don't have anywhere else to...I've said a few times you gotta just go reach down, find something and just work harder. I think burnout is when you lose the ability to do that, when you go inward to try to see if you can push yourself more and your brain and your body and your soul just say "No, no more".  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**

When you feel like you don't belong. This is gonna be a bit of a personal definition, but uh, I felt that hard at Michigan my first semester, because I was doing so poorly in my classes for the first time in my life. I had worked my whole life to get to this one place, and then I felt like I wasn't worthy of being there.  

**I believe you've said you've experienced burnout. Could you elaborate on some of your experiences there?**  

Yeah. Well, I've had it a lot, but my quintessential burnout experience is the morning after I turned in the shortform documentary piece I mentioned earlier about my uncle. 'cause I was up still editing at five, probably fell asleep at seven, and then was in class the next morning at nine. And we played all of our projects in class, and I remember there were some people that just didn't have them. Like they just didn't finish it. And my brain just said, "What? You...what?"  

Like I just didn't get it because of how hard I had worked to get it done. And then when mine played, I just broke down. I was so sleep deprived, I had worked so hard, I was so, so sad because of my uncle. And then to find out that people in my classes just didn't do it, uh, hurt. And then to watch what I had made - which was very good, I'm very, very proud of it - but it was also very emotionally heavy for me. I just had no processing power left. I just broke down in the middle of my class. Thank God the lights were off and the dude next to me didn't say anything, 'cause I was just...I just had no more gas in the tank. And I went home and slept for 15 hours, but...yeah. It happened at other points in undergrad, times when I'd procrastinated studying. But that's the most acute moment for sure.  

**And I believe you've also said that you've experienced imposter syndrome. Could you also elaborate on some of your experiences there as well?**  

Yeah, that was something I struggled with a lot at Michigan.  

I don't really know why, 'cause I knew the work I put in, right? That alone should have given me the confidence, or maybe not confidence, but reasoning to say I belong here. I know what I put myself through to get here. But when I started struggling, my first instinct was "Everybody else around here is having a great time". Not true, but "Everybody else around here is having a great time. It's you, you're struggling because you're the odd one out". It felt like every time I got over that, I had another challenge that I struggled with, and then it was back to the imposter syndrome thing. Like the acapella group, when I first got in, I was the worst guy there.  

I'm a talented musician, but I've never made it anywhere. I've made it on talent alone, right? I'm a talented guy, but the reason I've gotten anywhere is because of my work ethic. So when I walked into that room my junior year, I was the worst guy there, and I needed to work really hard to get on par with the guys. So that was tough because it was like, "Fuck, I worked so hard just to get in and now I need to work even harder just to hang around". When that happens, it's hard to fight those feelings that maybe you just don't belong. But you know, you work harder, you get over yourself, and you figure it out. But I struggled with that for a long time.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout was among your peers?**  

I think like, everybody had it to different degrees. I'd say my ChemE friends were the worst. My ChemE friends and my girlfriend in my senior year, especially for her, were probably the people that had it the worst. My girlfriend at the time was the president of two different student organizations while also having transferred to LSA, which was wild, and she was taking some really hard classes. And she was studying environmental science, I think it was - I can't remember exactly. So her classes were basically saying "Global warming is going to murder the planet". <laugh> So she just had so much on her plate. So she was going through it, my chemical engineering buddies, holy shit, man. I've seen some people work and then I've seen what those guys do. I think and I thought that I worked hard at Michigan, but my man Owen and my man Joe were at the UGLI every day until 4:00 AM just trying to pass their classes. <laugh>

Like *everybody's* burnt out, man. I feel like the only people that aren't are the ones that can't be taking their classes seriously. If you're not burnt out at Michigan, - this is not an appropriate sentence, nor should it be the vibe - but if you're not burnt out at Michigan, you're probably not taking something seriously. Or you've probably done the mental calculus in your brain to know "In order to stay sane, I can't give 110% to this", which is something I did a modicum of after my junior year. But you know, I still experienced burnout, so I didn't quite figure it out entirely.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome was among your peers?**  

I don't know about that one. I know I felt it really hard. I think one of my closest friends felt it too. I don't think my ex felt it at all; there's just some people that have that confidence, and I think I've learned it now, to say "Nah, man, I'm here because I deserve to be here and because I should be here". But I know at least three or four people that had it, that I was fairly close to, that I thought the world of. And I know they'd say the same thing about me. We all busted our ass. We're all worthy, smart, dependable, great individuals that struggle when they fail. And you know, have tough times putting the blame on things that aren't themselves and their own self-worth. So definitely less prevalent than burnout, definitely still pervasive.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and your experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Oh man. I feel like it helped my imposter syndrome, weirdly enough. 'cause for me, COVID was the great equalizer. It happened and I was like, "Holy shit, nobody knows anything, we're all in the same boat. Wow." Burnout though, that one was tough. COVID affected my motivation more than any singular thing in my life, hands down. It was really, really hard to get out of bed with the realization that there was this existential threat literally just outside. I knew it probably wasn't gonna kill me, I knew it probably wasn't gonna kill any of my friends. But my dad's immunocompromised, my sister is, my mom isn't that young anymore. You don't think about those things every day necessarily, but you do feel the weight. And that really fucked with my motivation.  

Like when I started the app, it was really hard, really, really hard to say, "Okay, now I gotta message this teacher on LinkedIn to get their input", just because that's what I gotta do to push the needle forward when I'd get up. And it'd be like, "Oh, my aunt's sick". Or "Oh, I still can't leave my house". Or all those plans I set for myself, just gone. That was the thing that I think messed with me the most, all of these things that, you know - I grew up being told, you go to school, you work hard, you graduate, and things will work for you. You still have to work, but you have this plan in place. It's almost like candy land, right? You draw the "You went to university of Michigan card", you go to this space, you take the gumdrop forest shortcut that nobody else gets and you go to this space and you're the first one out the door to get whatever opportunity you're looking for. And I began to feel the dividends from that when I was graduating, like halfway through my senior second semester senior year. And then all of it was just gone. So that was really hard because it was hard to tell whether anything was going to be a concrete option ever again. I loved music in high school, but I chose not to pursue it because I was worried about the lack of stability, and so to then go into COVID and have everything be so completely unstable rocked me and completely destroyed my motivation.  

**Close to wrapping up: considering everything that we've talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yeah. I mean, it was hard. It was really, really hard. But I think I'm better for how hard it was.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

You know, I don't think I knew too much about it. I wasn't the most naive guy on earth, but I was pretty naive. My hometown, it's a relatively sheltered place. And I came from a really, really stable household, barring some mental health problems. I had a pretty good relationship with my parents, and I was able to go home and be restful every day, pretty much, even though I was working really hard. So in my brain, there was always this aspect when I was young of "Well, why can't you just work harder?" And you know, once you get put through the crucible that is UofM, you realize "Ah, there's a limit". Everybody's got one, everybody's is different, but there's definitely a limit.

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**

Regarding imposter syndrome, I'd just say "Man, look at the work." I spent so long battling that, and...it's just, look at the work man. There is nothing more concrete to prove that you belong in this place than what you have done to get here. it wasn't easy - trust that! Trust the work! You know how to do it, just do it. It's gonna be harder. It's gonna be a lot harder than you're used to, so much more. There's gonna be so many challenges from so many different places. I would probably give 'em the heads up about COVID. But you know, just trust the work, man.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

I touched on it a little bit earlier, but for as hard as Michigan was, I'm still very glad that I went. And for as burnt out as I was, and for all of that imposter syndrome that I felt, I do think it helped make me stronger. Well, I don't think the imposter syndrome helped me at all. I wish I had figured out how to put that behind me sooner. But...burnout is terrible, don't get me wrong, but knowing how hard you are able to push yourself when the chips are down is valuable. I wouldn't recommend doing it as much as it happens at Michigan necessarily, but it is good to know that you can go to that place when you really absolutely have to. I'm glad that I have that.

**Alright. In that case, that is all that I have for you and I'll stop recording here.**
