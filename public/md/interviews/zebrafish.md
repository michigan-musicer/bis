**So to warm up, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Yeah sure. I went to a high school in Michigan. Um, I was there for four years...before that, I went to middle school, before that I went to - what type of specifics do you want to know?  

**People have brought up stuff related to their experience at college, which usually means AP classes, IB...but I keep it open ended because I don't want people to be forced to say stuff, I guess?**  

If you want something, you're gonna have to tell me, 'cause I don't really find that relevant to where I'm at today.  

**Okay.**   

**Approximately how many people would you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Everyone here, so maybe 40,000 people.    

**How many years have you been in your majors?**  

I declared my first major, which was premed, when I first came in freshman year, in the fall, and I decided to pick up a philosophy major the following year, sophomore year, when I took more philosophy classes. But I officially declared it last semester, junior second semester.   

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Yeah, that's a good question - I've had to think about this a lot. I guess I first came into college thinking, "I'm gonna finish in two and a half years. I'm gonna get in and out as fast as possible, just take the bare minimum requirements", and my first major always intrigued me because I really liked science. I like biology and chemistry, it was just fun; and I had the prereqs for it and I wanted to jump in. So I ended up taking a bio class, and I really enjoyed learning about the nitty-gritty science stuff. But I guess as I kept going, science kind of lost its allure, in the sense that it felt removed from the real world around me. Which I know is ironic considering philosophy is not much more grounded, but it was from the opposite end.  

Science felt like you took a microscope, zoomed in, and then zoomed in again, and it felt like it gave answers to a deep itch inside of me of how things worked in the world. But it seemed to miss a fundamental aspect of our existence as humans and what life meant. And I guess I was going through a rough time after freshman year, to do with sickness, to do with health - which made me reflect more on life. The philosophy class I took really helped me ponder those issues that were coming up more and more about what I wanted out of life, what happiness meant, how the best way to go about achieving that is. And so I fell in love with the ethics class I continued to take and the logic class, and then a history class, and I just decided to also do a philosophy major, which seemed to compliment the premed major and encompass what I was missing.

It was a feeling of lostness, and I guess giving the room to think helped me refocus. Or at least put in a different perspective, being lost in a different way.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

As in negative, positive?  

**It can be either.**  

I guess like coming into premed, it was very, very interesting to me to see how some people really tried gunning forward and appearing like they knew what they were talking about and convinced the people around us to think the same. For example, they started talking about how they already read the textbook before class even started. Meanwhile, I had not even bought the textbook or even knew that the textbook existed. They started quoting things in later chapters, which I soon would learn to be wrong, misunderstood information. I guess in that moment I felt like I was behind. I felt like I was...I don't know, insufficient, in terms of like, "Wow, everyone else is already on top of it, I don't know how I'm gonna do this", but I ended up just going at my own pace.  

And I started realizing that a lot of what they did wish to show and that they didn't actually understand what they were talking about, and it was just like an outwards appearance to make other people feel like they were bigger. We all were kind of just at our own pace of learning. I think that really was the first encounter I had with the whole go-getter pre-med energy of toxicity. I've been lucky enough to have a supportive friend group, and through study groups I was able to avoid that. But the way people would flood office hours and ask questions about things way ahead in the units...meanwhile, I was trying to just, like, get by - I think it actually discouraged me from going to office hours. But then again, that's when I started to learn more that we all were kind of in it together.  

I also feel the same things in some philosophy classes, I guess, where people try to appear like they know more about certain subjects by using big words. Meanwhile, I've always felt myself removed from that, because I might not understand what they're talking about or the texts don't seem to make sense to me right away. People didn't seem to wanna admit that either and appeared like they already knew everything - which some people did, to be fair, but they had also invested lots of time. So I don't know, people just tried to fake it till they make it.  

**Okay. What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in an average semester?**  

20? Do you mean a job or do you mean also clubs and stuff?  

**Everything that you would consider work, so basically not rest.**  

Oh, at least 90 hours. Every waking moment. <laugh>  

**Could you elaborate?**  

I don't know. I didn't feel like I was much at rest throughout any of my time during the school year. Am I understanding what you mean by that?  

**Uh, I'm just trying to narrow down...what if you keep it to, say, working on homework and studying, going to classes, "actual" work, and any extracurriculars? We can do those four things.**  

It depends. Some weeks I've been working 26 hours and actually have three different jobs, I'm taking like 12 credits - I'm not doing any of this well, 'cause there's so much going on at once. Um, I'm doing research, which is four hours, five hours, actually closer to nine hours a week. I have to cook and all that, which is a different type of work. Some classes differ; some semesters. I'm really spending a lot of time doing work. Some years I'll take 18 credit hours. Recently. I've been taking much less to try balancing it with the outside stuff. It's hard to put averages 'cause each semester looks so different, but basically the gist of it is that I overload myself and it's not good.  

**Are you able to put down an average number per week? Or is a number not possible?** 

If you want a number for work? I can tell you 20.  

**Sorry, I meant everything.**  

Again, during the academic year, every waking moment seems to be about school. So maybe I have...let's see. A day is 24 hours. I'd sleep for around eight - that's being generous. These are school days, I have maybe three or four classes a day. So let's just say three hours a day, 20 hours of class per week; I think that's how much it works out to be. And then homework too, maybe 30, so 50 hours total. And then you add on clubs, another five hours, four hours. So you're at 54, 55 - some weeks are much more than others. And then the general stuff will be...maybe 60, we'll say 60.  

**Okay.**  

But that doesn't count weekends. It's okay, 60 will work. I don't count studying in that. 

**Okay.**  

It's hard to quantify with such an abstract question.  

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester? When I say waking rest, I mean time that you're taking to relax during the day.**  

I really get what I can. I try to force myself to relax during walks to classes and stuff, but I'm often on the go during the school year. Every now and then I get to hang out with friends, but I wouldn't say that's necessarily relaxing. So the hours I sleep, maybe...I don't think I can give you a specific estimate, because it changes so much. Some weeks I might skip all classes and just relax; but even while relaxing...with depression, they don't really feel like relaxing. It just feels like lounging. So it's not a thing I can answer well.  

**Okay.**  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

I guess this last semester I worked 20 hours per week at actual jobs, and then I had nine hours per week at research, and then classes were a lot, for essays, and then the club stuff - so many hours. One week I counted literally 40 hours in a club, but that was an anomaly. I'd say it's close to maybe three or four. So yeah. But my freshman year also, premed was a lot and clubs were a lot. Yeah. I'd say I had more free time during quarantine.  

**For those semesters that you mentioned, are you able to give average numbers of waking rest hours per week?**  

Not much at all? Okay, maybe I would do stuff on the weekends or evening some days. I try to reserve, let's just say, an hour every day. Then maybe on the weekends, like on Friday, say four hours in the evening, and then say Saturday, Sunday, seven hours each day. It's hard to feel restful when this weight of everything is lying in your head too. Even if you might be doing something for leisure, I wouldn't say it's rest if you define rest as recovery. I don't know. I define rest as *past* recovery. I don't know.  

Is that helpful? I'm trying to give as detailed and accurate answers as possible. 

**That's helpful.** 

**What is the most number of hours you have worked in a single week?**

Weekend? 

**Week, sorry.**  

Oh. What do you define work as? Everything?  

**Yeah.**  

I told you the club was literally 46 hours. I had an essay due that weekend too. So I'd say I spent another 10 hours on that. I still had classes, which I'd say...14 credits, 14 hours roughly. And then I'd research. You're counting all these right? Because I can't add all of them.  

**I can count them later. [88 is the final count following the information below.]**  

Yes. And then I also had work, but that week was a little lighter. I'd say 10 hours, because I had two jobs and usually I would work 10 hours at each. Or 12 and closer to six, so maybe 18, if you want to be more precise.  

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I structure my time such that I have no control. So in that way I have a lot of control, but I set myself up for failure by overloading my schedule and commitments. Therefore I don't have control. But that's an active choice that I make.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, I felt like I needed to really find purpose in it. I guess writing essays has gotten progressively difficult. For example, I used to be able to write it all in one sitting. Next, I used to be able to write it in an all-nighter before the deadline. And then I used to be able to write it in an all-nighter and then another day past the deadline. And in my last semester, my essays I literally turned in a week late - the first one of the term. Second one, I turned in a month late. Then the last one, I just waited till the last possible day to turn it in. 

In terms of studying for science classes, that seems more of a "You just do it and it happens" thing because of how my brain works, versus essays. So I don't have as much struggle with that, because I can force myself to sit and binge watch lectures, even if I fall behind. But with an essay, you must put thought and energy into it. Not that either is good practice, but I often feel more stressed about essays. I don't know what the question is, I forget.    

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, life circumstances became more and more important outside of work and outside of academics. I started realizing that the real world existed and things started going wrong in different aspects, or becoming more and more needing of attention and more serious. Academics became more of either an outlet for my own personal inquiry or less important and paled in comparison to other things going on in my life. Therefore I wasn't able to devote as much enthusiasm, especially when I felt overworked or stressed or sad.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Of course, yes. As a freshman I was able to do much more than I am now, in some ways. Now I just feel tired.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

So before I was able to get very, very consistently very, very good grades. And as things became worse and worse outside of school, I slowly got worse grades, and these last two semesters I got slightly worse grades. I think they're fine to be honest, but the amount of sweat and tears into them are not fun. Philosophy mostly is what screws me over, or screws with my head. Very difficult. 

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

I've been better about it in terms of my work internship now. My goals have had to shift in mindset to be less prestigious - or not less prestigious, but smaller. Often setting goals makes it harder in some ways, if I make the goals too big to even do it. So making small goals has helped me. For example, instead of finishing this essay by this date, I will say "Sit down and write one sentence" or just type out thoughts on a paper. Or my goal might be to send my professor an email saying I'm struggling and to give me an extra week or month.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or especially strong student?**

I'd say so.

**Could you elaborate?**  

People considered me, so yes. What do you want me to elaborate about? I don't think that they're realistic. I don't think that it's healthy to put those labels on people, for both the person they put the label on, as well as all people who don't receive those labels. But I will say that yeah, people thought that.

If you want more specifics, let me know, but that's not something I dwell on.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Yes, I do. Do you want me to elaborate on that?  

**Where does the pressure to be superhuman come from and how does it feel?**  

It comes both from myself as well as watching everyone else succumb to the same pressure. I think that there is some prestige associated with the university being very good, but also at the same time, not the best. So people around you try to make up for it and therefore point down other people around you. So if you're exposed to that, then you start to internalize it to some extent, unless you find a supportive friend group or something - for which I am lucky to have found, but I have still seen the culture of wanting to do too much around me. It's become so internalized for everyone to be such a workhorse and to do as much as possible insanely, as that is one of the main mechanisms with which people have gone into this college in the first place, and therefore we all have that ingrained in us to some extent. We see it around us too, everyone failing upwards to meet those standards. I hope that what I said is coherent; let me know if you need it rephrased.  

**That's good.**  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

I had to learn to love it. I used to fear it a lot more than I do now, and it has given me so much more control over myself and the emotions I feel to let things go, such as not being able to turn in an essay on time for a month and prolonging the deadline. It has given me so much more life to be doing that than it is to just submit it on time after an all-nighter and struggling, worrying. It's okay to fail in that sense, and I've accepted that I won't be able to do everything. I think it is integral to who I am today and has appeared many times within my life; yet I realize that it'll continue to happen and it will not hinder wherever I will end up, because I'll end up there regardless. I also realize that academic failure is much more high-stakes in our mind than it is in the real world outside of that bubble. Because what I might define as failure, it might be seen as an achievement that I even got to the point where I could make that failure, from an outside perspective. Being okay with not doing what you need to and failing has allowed me to become better at doing more things, as well as being me to myself.  

**Okay. How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

It depends how it's phrased. In what sense? So for example, if someone minimizes the effort and work that went into the academic praise, then of course I will feel bad and I'll feel annoyed and feel like it was unhealthy for that to happen. If someone recognizes how much I'm struggling and phrases it - not so much the fact that the grade has happened, that I've got something, but they recognize the effort that I put in and say that the grade is a reflection of that, or it doesn't even matter, that I'm okay with. So as long as it's focused around the individual and not focused around the grade itself, I'm okay with the praise. 

Because the grade itself can mean a lot of things, and it often is a reflection, but not even accurate of how well you were doing. 'cause a lot of it is arbitrary too and dependent on outside factors that you can't control. So for example, academic praise can look like someone saying, "Oh my god, you got an A, that's so good", or "oh my god, you got this or this, wow". Versus, "Wow, I'm so proud of you for starting your essay. I know that was hard for you." That still is an academic act that received praise.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Depends on what, often mixed. For example, if it's something I feel like I put a lot of energy into and I feel like I deserved, then I'll feel good. If I succeed but still feel bad, it often is because there's something underlying and I feel unresolved in how I got to that point, or I feel undeserving of it. I often minimize it just because I don't feel like I need to focus on successes. So in some ways I'm uncomfortable with it, but I've learned to cherish it a lot more too. For example, when I get an opportunity or something, I have learned not to question it so much, so as to sometimes just embrace it and accept it.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

Depends if they're toxic or supportive. Some people truly are happy for your own happiness. Some people view it as an affront to theirs and tear you down for it or focus the conversation upon themselves, how they're failing or how they're succeeding. Those people I try not to associate with. The people who focus on me as an individual and view me isolated from them in terms of success or failure, I keep close to my heart. The rest I wear like a sleeve that can be cast off. I don't know what the saying is.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes. I do live it as well.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

I feel it as putting in too much energy all at once to achieve a thing, and it taking such a toll upon you that it's no longer sustainable with healthy practices. And you would sacrifice something integral that makes you feel empty, tired. And can be often associated with depression or anxiety.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Feeling that you don't belong.  

**You stated that you believe you've experienced burnout. Do you care to elaborate on some of your experiences?**  

Yeah, sure. I move too fast. I sacrifice things to do academics instead - for example, friends, I do not see them. Sacrifice my own mental health, sometimes I have, and um, that looks like the all-nighters that I would've had done many times in a row. I sacrifice health in terms of not doing any physical activity that makes me feel good or doing any activities that make me happy, such as watching a movie, relaxing...and afterwards, it is too much, and therefore I feel burnt out. For example, as happened freshman year: once COVID hit, I really realized that at the same time I got sick, and it really all came crashing down as I came home, isolated. I had spent the entire year really just grinding on everything, and it had come to a culmination point that almost manifested in physical symptoms I was noticing as my illness also came. And just this feeling of weakness and emptiness. Burnout, again, occurs when you realize that things are starting to fall apart at the seams of your life, that otherwise seems pretty tied together - and others claim it as such. Yet to you, it feels like it is falling apart.  

You start to notice small things go awry, such as you forget lunch at home, your relationships with others, like friends, for example, might become less involved, distanced, separated, isolated...relationships with people you're talking to in romantic sense also get messed up. You are able to devote less energy, start to get irritated at yourself more, it starts to get harder - when you even need to sit down for simple tasks, it gets too much. And you just feel like it's too much and you want to run away from it all. Or you want the world to pause and freeze and you want to stop. And that has happened as well, this last semester when I had done too much stuff, too much work, too much of everything, and I really had to slow down. 

I'm realizing I'm going backwards by doing the opposite, by saying the abstract and ending it with experience? So if you want me to rephrase that, I can. This is my stream of consciousness, so if I was writing it out, I'd probably reverse them. Let me know if you'd want me to do that.  

**It's fine as is. The transcription will cover this.**

**Do you believe you have experienced imposter syndrome?**  

I feel that all the time in my philosophy classes, as I'm not a writer. And I struggle with it despite me knowing that my writing itself is good. What I realized in stark contrast was - taking a 400-level philosophy class, I don't feel like I fit in already. Barely convinced myself to do the major. I'm already very depressed. I'm struggling a lot with outside stuff in school, life, whatever. And I guess I'm not able to devote as much time to read the papers as I need to. I don't have time to read it three times, or it takes me reading the same passage three or four times to understand it. And in class, I would be feeling so much imposter syndrome because it seemed like the people around me were just gunning at the answers, saying these very deep things.  

But sometimes they really would just be saying nothing, or I realized that they hadn't even read the pieces and they were just talking. That became very stark once I went to office hours and told GSI that I felt imposter syndrome in the class, and she said, "I can tell people are just talking what they read online on SparkNotes, some of it's just wrong" and things like that, regurgitating stuff. So while some of the thoughts were very original, a lot of them were just bullshit and they just bullshited well; and they seemed to hold themselves in a aura that made it seem like others' thoughts were stupid. But in some ways, they also were very good at thinking, because philosophy is about logic and thinking.   

So I felt imposter syndrome, but then I also reflected on why I wanted to take classes and what I wanted out of them. That was independent of how they acted and how I fit in with them. So even if I struggled with the readings - maybe I couldn't do it all or maybe I could, it didn't matter - I get what I need out of it. And I understand it my own way, and I pay attention in class, so that's what matters. And I try my best and I know that it's okay if I can't do much better, 'cause some people do have very strong suits, which is good for them. And maybe I'm not cut out for some things too, which I acknowledge; but you still have a place there. And if you really want, you can be better.  

Like, for example, I'm not cut out to read old philosophy all day, it's too hard for me. But I don't think that's imposter syndrome. I think that's just that I realize I don't prioritize it enough to feel bad about that, or devote myself to it.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

Very high. I feel everyone must face it unless they're very, very structured in themselves and are able to separate themselves from what's happening. Some people deal with it very well in the sense that they don't put as much emphasis on classes, they might have much bigger support networks that are very healthy and not as toxic and really support wellbeing first and foremost; and there's things that give them fulfillment that aren't reliant on productivity and producing.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

Very high. Almost everyone I talk to.  

**Could you elaborate on how you've seen imposter syndrome manifest in your peers?**  

In all aspects: people being cocky, acting like they know more, people feeling like they can't participate in classes, people feeling like their voice doesn't matter. People feeling like they must compensate for it by studying an insane amount, people feeling like they must sacrifice everything in life to achieve things. People feeling like they're not meant for certain paths and stopping and giving up, people accepting it and believing it, all those.  

**Okay.**  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Forced me to reevaluate what I was doing, why I was doing it. So it forced me to use the downtime to figure out how to spend time with myself outside of the productivity that this capitalist society really encourages. It was a stark truth. It was a nasty truth, almost, that I overloaded myself all the time and never spent time to deal with emotions that I felt. And I realized that wasn't sustainable, for me personally, that I was going too far too fast. So I started realizing I needed to make changes if I wanted to continue.

**Alright, close to wrapping up. Considering everything that we've talked about today, do you and have you enjoyed your academic work?**  

My enjoyment of them really had to do with how much time I was able to give myself to devote to it and if I was able to connect it back to my life.

So some semesters, yes, I loved it. And other semesters, no. This past semester, I feel like I haven't got as much out of the academic classes as I would've liked, except for one class. During COVID, the fall semester of 2020, I felt like that was the most fulfilling, if not the winter, in terms of my classes. Because of the philosophy classes, I really was able to connect to where I was at in life. I feel like as life got more packed with other things outside classes, I was able to devote less. I wasn't able to find as much fulfillment through my classes. But that coincides with depression and the onset of other things.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I knew what it meant. I had burned out in high school in some ways. I think I never really fully recovered from my habits in high school, which is why college was so bad in some ways. For example, I developed those unhealthy habits during high school, and I kept myself under big stresses to achieve a lot, and it got to the point where I literally would just pass up opportunities or not devote myself fully to them because of that - which I am at peace with. I realize it wasn't right for me in that timeframe. So I guess I was already familiar with it. I just was able to keep going longer unless things outside of high school affected it.  

Imposter syndrome I didn't feel in high school, unless I was with people who actually compared themselves and stuff.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Go slower. Spend more time outside to reflect on who you are and what you want out of life and what you want out of classes.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

College is only a small time of your life. It doesn't matter in the long scheme of things in terms of making you happy or not. You have to find that yourself. Life isn't lived through books and studies. There are other aspects that if you neglect, cannot lead to a full life either - and maybe that's a path you choose, but be aware of it and be cognizant when choosing it.   

Um, focus on yourself, because ultimately we all die separately. Even when together, we live separate lives, and there's no point in comparing hours and living hours in context of the others - in terms of constantly comparing it, because we all live in context of each other. I phrased that poorly. Try to see what makes you happy, focus on yourself. Nothing is as big as it seems to be. You can get to the same place no matter what, there's so many different ways. Or maybe the place isn't right. You belong. Find support systems and networks. Evaluate who you spend your time around and how they make you feel and whether they build or tear you down. Are these coherent thoughts?  

**Yes.**  

Okay. Then I'm done.

**Alright. In that case, that wraps up the interview. I'll stop recording there and thank you for your participation.**
