**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Um, so honestly my education wasn't kind of the best. It was the best for the region. It was, uh, okay. Kind of the primary problem was, uh, I wasn't born in America. So when I came here, my English was pretty bad. For my parents, the number one thing, period, was getting a school where I could learn English fast. And there's a school where there's a lot of help because of who the school is founded by, and it kind of overlaps with where I'm from too. So we both spoke the same “other” language, and that was very helpful; but the district it's in is not the best. 

For instance, one thing that really sucked when going to high school was I had no physics at all. That was actually one of the questions UofM raised when I was applying, like, "How the heck did you never take physics?" And I remember taking physics here at first. Especially when they were covering the first things, even things like vectors, I had no idea what they were talking about originally. But over time it was okay. I hope that kind of gives you an idea.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Uh, if I have to put a number to it...  

**Doesn't have to be exact.** 

I would say roughly 10, though most of those are either friends - like people who I know from even before coming to UofM - or people who I spend a lot of time with on say, project team. That's mostly the people I connect the most with.  

**How many years have you been in your major?** 

Uh, I declared the summer after freshman year. So one year.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

So in high school, I did have a single course that was programming-related, which was in Python, and coming in I still wasn't sure if CS was totally something I wanted to do. I kind of wanted to give a little wiggle room, if that makes sense. I always found computers interesting, so computer engineering seemed like a perfect choice. Because a lot of computer engineers do software, and at the same time, a lot of them do hardware. So it kinda gives me options down the road.  

**Okay. What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Interesting, interesting...um, I don't know. That's a hard question.  

**Doesn't have to be the most memorable, but any one that stands out.**  

Uh, I hope it's not a cliche answer...but for me personally, UofM was just a big step up. 'cause college in general is a big step up, and I feel like UofM especially, because it always tries to be top university and it's up there, and it's just very demanding of you. So freshman year was a little bit of a shock, you know, just the difficulty spike was a little bit shocking. But yeah, it's all fun I guess. Sorry that I don't have the best answer.  

**It's all good. What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in an average semester?**  

Uh let's think...this includes like, attending classes?  

**Yeah, whatever you would consider work.**  

I'd say seven or eight hours a day during weekdays. Usually Saturday I slack off a little bit, take things easier, and then Sunday would be back into it. So again, maybe like eight hours or nine, something like that, and on Sunday too. Saturday, I would give it two hours. So if you could just add those numbers for me, that'd be it, like eight times six plus four. That's about it.  

**Uh, 52, that sound correct?**  

Yeah.  

**Alright. Then for that average week, in an average semester, what was the average number of rest hours you got?**  

It'd basically be anything outside of that time, plus or minus maybe like an hour or two hours a day because of, I dunno, making food? Does that count as rest? I wouldn't think so, right?  

**Uh, whatever you would consider rest. So if you don't count that as rest, then don't count it.**  

I probably honestly count it, cause it's still relaxing in a sense. So for me personally, especially during the school year, anytime I'm doing homework, doing anything for a class, I consider work. Anything else? It's just rest pretty much. Even if I'm on the bus listening to music, I'm kind of resting.  

I should keep better track of times. <laugh>  

**Yeah, I was about to ask if you can put a number on that. If not, then just a range is fine.**  

So I said eight hours of work and maybe eight hours of sleep? So then you get six hours per day or something. Maybe. Okay.  

Yeah, I don't know. The thing is - I have to admit, there are days where almost the entire day, I barely did anything; but then there are days where the entire day I pretty much did something. I just never kept numbers on this thing, so it's a little bit tough to give an estimate. Sorry.  

**No, that's fair. I guess for now I can say six times seven, which is 42?**  

Yeah, that sounds okay.  

**Okay. What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Busiest semester? I would honestly say that almost every semester, I worked about the same. There wasn't a significant spike, and I feel that's because I'm still, I just finished sophomore year. So a lot of the courses I think are still pretty similar, like math, physics and a few early EECS courses. So maybe if it was a bit busier, then maybe each day I would spend maybe an extra hour, if you're averaging it out.  

**Would you say a similar number of rest hours then too?**

Yeah, just subtract the one hour and that sounds about right.  

**What is the most number of hours you worked during a single week?**  

Single week? A lot of numbers, I keep having to track numbers! <laugh> So there were days where it was like, you wake up, you work until maybe 8 PM plus a break somewhere in between to eat for an hour - and by wake up, I mean like eight or nine, I can't remember. <laugh> But let's just say nine. So wake up at nine, work, plus one hour break until eight, then rest for two or three hours and go sleep. And that's seven hours for sleep, hopefully!  

**Could you describe an example of that week in a bit more detail?**  

Mostly it's a mix of projects / exams / homework. I would say it would be busiest if there's exams, uh, especially back to back weeks. Not in the same week, 'cause I feel like honestly having all the exams in the same week might be a little bit easier. What happens is you don't have homework or you don't have projects due that same week, 'cause none of the classes would make you do homework or projects the week of the exam. 

So sometimes you have an exam, let's say on week one and then week two, you have two exams, but then the two classes still make you do homework. So I'm like, working on a homework and preparing for week one exam, and then at the same time trying to prepare for week two exams. So it's like doing a lot of stuff at the same time in like a single week. And honestly, I would define a week mostly depending on the dates of the exam. So sometimes that week could be from Wednesday to Wednesday. 

That's what I'm considering here, 'cause a lot of deadlines and exams happen later in the week. It kind of shifts, like crunch hours a little bit.  

**That makes sense, okay.** 

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

Honestly - and maybe you would be surprised - I feel like I had way more control than I did in high school. In high school, it felt like you have your set classes and you just go to them. Here, it's honestly a little bit more complicated. So I kind of experiment over time, 'cause I've had friends tell me, "Oh, I never go to lectures", and then friends will tell me "Oh, I always go to lecture". So it's kind of making hard decisions sometimes, like you have an exam during the week and like, should I be attending a lecture? Should I be skipping them? But then when will I catch up on them? So it's kind of like I have a lot of control over it; I just have to be careful with it or I could really hurt myself in a sense.

**Mm-hmm. Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Honestly, I think it's by semester for me. It's not like, "Oh, at the start of freshman year, I loved UofM, and I hate it now!" Honestly, even now I'm a little bit excited to go back to school in the fall. It's just that during the actual semester - I noticed this was a little bit worse during winter semester for me. In fall, I feel like Thanksgiving break is just a good timing, because it's about time where I've had enough. It's where I'm getting tired of things, and that break hits at a good time, and it's a good rest time right before the final stretch. Whereas in the winter, we have our break very early, and I'm not exhausted at that moment in time. I'm still kinda excited around, like, exam two times.  

So a lot of classes go by three exams, right? So first exam, second exam, final. Around exam two time, like right after that, I feel pretty burned out, because that's where the pace is really high. The first, say, five weeks, usually they're pretty light still. After that, you hit the first exam, and then between first and second exams it's usually pretty fast, and then towards final times it's even worse. And so like around exam two it usually gets a little tough. And so just because of how Thanksgiving break works out, it kind of makes it so much easier. But in the winter, towards the end when it's the start of April, I'm like "I'm just wishing this semester was over", a little bit.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began UofM?**  

Probably a similar story; I feel like energy and enthusiasm kind of go hand in hand, for me at least. And how I'm considering energy here is just my willingness to get out of bed and do stuff, not just schoolwork. It's kind of anti-productive, but I feel like when I'm more excited, I do way more, even at times when I don't need to do a lot, you know? So I do extra stuff just because I'm excited about it. 

But then towards the end of the semester, I'm kind of burned out. A lot of people spend a lot of time studying for finals and things like that, and sometimes I found I just couldn't. I would stare at the book or whatever, and it just wouldn't do anything for me anyways. 'cause it's at that point where I'm kinda wishing it was over already, and so there's no energy to do anything. It's kind of unfortunate, 'cause that's when you probably wanna do the most, because it's finals!  

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Uh, not really, I feel like I've kind of stayed on the same level of academic success. I do think I did a little bit better freshman year, and I would say a problem with that is a little bit, uh - so most people get their freshman year to experiment with living alone. I was a COVID kid, so sophomore year was basically freshman year. It was a big mix of two things. Also, my housing was kind of screwed up for a first month during the first semester, so there were a few, uh, external issues that kind of made it a little bit more annoying in my life and put a little bit of stress. But yeah, it hasn't changed much, at least as far as I can tell.  

**Alright, shifting gears a little bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Interesting question. So I feel like I'm one of those people who - if you ever heard the phrase, "Aim for the stars, hit the moon", I feel like I do that. So I probably don't achieve my goals very often. I always set the expectation to do the best I can, not the best possible. And then just kind of see how well I actually do. The reason I do that is I feel like, uh, even if I'm doing well in class - let's say I have a 90, and let's say A is 93. I'm not gonna back up; I'm gonna keep trying. I'm gonna keep trying to get that A! All I can do.

I wouldn't be satisfied at that level, even if maybe there's other courses. Which is maybe a little bit unfortunate and something I would say I'm probably a little bit bad at sometimes. Like let's say I have a 90 in a course and then another one I have an 80. So probably need to work more on the 80, but I still kind of spend time evenly. I don't care! 'cause in both courses I wanna do as best as I can.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or especially strong student?**  

Uh, yeah. I graduated as a valedictorian, and part of that is because my particular class sucked. They just, my classmates did not care about school. I'm gonna be honest. There were a few who did, and some of them straight up didn't, so it kind of made it easy. So I didn't work the hardest. I still did my work; I still went home and I did the homework I was expected to. That's why I'm never super proud of finishing high school, because I just did what was expected of me, and the rest of the people didn't. That's why I was the best, or that's what I felt like sometimes.  

**Do you, or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**   

I know UofM does so much to help you understand imposter syndrome and not to focus on other people, but man, it's hard. You look around UofM, There's so many smart people and you're like "Dang, I wanna be like one of them!" You know, just so many high achieving people around you, and you wanna fit in. You don't wanna be the odd one out. I know like...like B average at UofM is still pretty great, because it's a great college and all of that. But there's so many people who get almost 4.0, and you look at them and you wanna be like those people. So it kind of pushes you to, even if you can't do amazing, do amazingly.  

**So would you count that as feeling pressure to be superhuman?**

A little bit, a little bit. I feel like from the college's perspective, they do a lot to help you not do that, but it's kind of just human nature. You look around, you try to be the best in your group, and it just so happens that UofM is quite a good college.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

Um, probably not the best. I'm trying to learn that failure is good. I always take it as a negative. I like...I know people always say you're supposed to learn from your failure. I don't feel like I always do; I feel like I look at the failure and I try to run from it, a little bit. So I told you how in high school I felt really smart. That was kind of all I did. I was just good in class, but only because my classmates were not the best. And then you come to UofM and you realize that there are other people who are smarter than you, or at least they do better in classes than you. And it's kind of like "Dang, I'm not good at anything".  

**How would you say that affects your relationship with failure necessarily?**  

Oh, sorry. Uh, I just don't like to fail, I guess? That's the best I can put it. That's because, um, it makes me almost feel...how I like to think of it is - maybe this is just me whining about it, <laugh> but in college I feel like failure is a little bit bad, because it reflects. If you fail an exam, you're probably not gonna get an A in the class. That's kind of like failure in this sense - it's gonna stay on your card, literally on your report card. Or the transcript, whatever - sorry, forgot the word for a second. It kind of stays with you. People a lot of the times try to paint a picture as "You fail, you kind of move on". It's almost as if your failure is not noticed by anyone, but it was noticed by you and you learn from it. I feel like in college, it's not as straightforward, because it almost stays with you forever in that sense.  

**Okay. How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I don't know. Maybe I don't get praised enough or something. <laugh> But praise...  

I don't think it makes me super happy in a sense, because, uh, how I see it is I'm expected to do those things. Maybe it's just how I felt in high school, and I continue to feel this way. Like you're expected to succeed in a sense - homework is given to you, projects are almost like chores...you just gotta do it, there's no way around it. So when you do something you're expected to do anyways and you do it well, it's like, why praise me? It's more like if you can't do it, then what are you doing here? How are you not able to do this? It's kinda expected.

**What feelings do you have when you succeed? I think you kind of touched on this just now.**  

Yeah, a little bit. If I fail, I'm really mad. Like "How am I failing?" But when I succeed, it's like "Okay, okay". I mean, it's good, but this is what it's supposed to be anyways.  

I like to think of it as - so let's say you're a scientist and you invent something brand new. That's a success. But if you just have a product or some idea and you just keep kind of improving on it or making it better, I mean, you're kind of supposed to do it. That's how I feel. If I keep doing well in classes, then I kind of have to - I'm a student, I have to do well in classes in a sense. 

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I don't know, I think it depends on the group. Usually if it's my family, they're probably happy. If it's UofM students, then I feel like they don't care. <laugh> A little bit, I mean, everyone has to worry about themselves, right? So you tell them you succeeded, and they're kind of excited for you, but if you're being honest, they kind of don't care at the same time. I mean, it's whatever. And I'm talking about academic success only, nothing else. So grades basically. If I tell someone "Oh, I did well on a test", they're gonna say "Oh, good job". But that's about it. There's not much expectation there.  

I feel like people talk more about when they fail than when they succeed, I don't know why. At least from my experience - you never come up to someone and say, "Oh my god, I killed that task, I did amazing". But when you did bad, you're like, "Come on, oh my god, that test was horrible", and both of you just end up complaining about it. Maybe a person who took it last semester or something.

**Okay. Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**

For me? Since we're talking academic here, I feel like burnout is the state where you...you're expected to do your homework, your project, study for an exam, and you were able to do it let's say, three, five weeks ago. But you're not able to do it anymore, because of the state you're in this semester. You just don't have the energy, you don't have the focus. And at that point when you really have burnout, it's not just about avoiding it - you'll find other things to do, like cleaning, cooking, anything to avoid it. Uh, so in a sense you are avoiding it. <laugh> What I was trying to say earlier was that it's not just "Oh, I'm not doing it, I'm just having fun". No, I'm literally going to replace it with different work just so I feel productive, but I'm not actually doing what I'm supposed to do. That's how I feel about burnout.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes, definitely. I think I mentioned a little bit how at UofM they're bringing it up a lot. Before UofM, I never heard of the term, But my freshman year, they kinda uncover the truth. The best examples, or the ones that I like the most - like I don't like when people just say "This is imposter syndrome, blah blah blah". I had a professor who actually gave a real life example, like an example from their life. I feel like those are the most meaningful, because...uh, do I need to define imposter syndrome? How I view it?  

**That was gonna be the next question, yeah. Like how would you define it in your own words?**  

Okay, for me imposter syndrome is when you're not able to...what's a good word...happy about your own success? Because there might be someone around you who is more successful. This is all kinda within the frame of academic stuff. Let's say you get an A-, which is a great grade! But maybe your friend has an A, so you don't feel like you succeeded because there's other people who did better. That's how I see it - you're not able to actually recognize your success, just because there are people who might have done better than you.  

**Mm-hmm.**

**Then could you go back to what you were saying about the professor's example?**  

Yes. The reason I like professors talking about it, especially from their life - like this one professor was talking about how he's not the only professor for the class. And he was talking about how within the same course, there are professors who've done way more research and have these other cool things going for them. And he kind of felt like he had imposter syndrome where he almost didn't feel like he's good enough to be teaching in a sense. But he did his best to explain that that's just kinda life. People just do different things, and you should never not recognize your own success and feel like you're out of place.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

I would say so. And again, going back to the winter semester because as good as winter break is, I think coming from high school, winter break is different. It's not an end of semester, it's just a temporary break. Because then you come back and you're still learning the same stuff for the most part - at least that's how my high school was like, because you were still working towards the same grade. It wasn't per-semester grades, it was per academic year. So for me, it still feels very connected, the two semesters, in a sense. Also, it's always like a blank sheet of paper when you start in winter. Then because there's no break at the right kind of time for me, towards the end I feel a little bit burned out. Like I'm just done with school, I want summer to start, I want a big break. Really get my head off of school and just do other things.

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

I would say...I think I experienced imposter syndrome more often than burnout, and I feel like that is - I think I mentioned this, but going back to how successful some students at UofM are, it's kind of hard to ignore that. That there are people who are getting 4.0s and like, you're not able to do it - I'm not able to do it. I dunno, it gets to me a little bit. I'm a little salty at times about that. And I never blame other people, and I at least try not to blame the course or professors. I mostly put it on myself that I'm not good enough.  

Also at times, it almost makes me feel a little bit like I'm not part of UofM. I tend to put UofM as a group of very successful and intelligent individuals, so whenever I feel stupid about something - especially if I'm talking to someone outside of UofM - I'm almost embarrassed to say I go to this school sometimes. Because I might show that I'm not actually as smart, almost like I'm a joke. You know what I mean? Because people hear UofM, especially here in Michigan, and they associate it with high standards. And if I'm not able to meet those, then I say "Oh, I go to UofM", they're like - it's not just that I'm stupid. It's like, "How are you in that school as well?" <laugh> If that makes sense.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

Honestly, I feel like a lot of my friends just bring this up towards the end of the year. Everyone's just like - I won't use specific words! - but everyone’s just like, "I want this to end already, I want the semester to be over, I'm ready for the new one". And yeah, burnout always happens towards I would say around the last three weeks. That's when most common conversations for me and my peers come up about how we really want the semester to just end already.  

**And how prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

So that's actually funny 'cause I did mention that I feel imposter syndrome more often than burnout, but burnout is what I talk about more with my peers. Imposter syndrome...you never really talk about that. I don't know. It feels a little bit weird, but I usually keep it to myself as well. I think it's because talking about imposter syndrome, it's more personal. You have to reveal more, like how well you're doing in a class, while you could have an A in the class and still wanted to end already and feel burnout. It's easier to say, "Oh man, I hate this class already, I just want it to end!" Whereas if it's like imposter syndrome, then you almost have to say, "Oh, I'm not doing well in the class, I wish I was like those other students". So it's less common that I talk about that.

**Okay. How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout syndrome?** 

I don't know how to say it, because my freshman year was during COVID - like major COVID. I didn't go to campus. I stayed fully remote to save money on housing, and I just didn't know what college was like before at all.  

I know you said you'll later ask this, but I'm a first gen, so I also don't have parents to look towards and ask questions. And COVID was there, so honestly, I don't know. I don't know if COVID made a big difference, it's hard for me to tell. I feel like people who at least had their freshman year normal and then switched, I feel like they got impacted more. Because for me, it was so new that I didn't notice COVID in a sense. In the big picture, COVID was just not there for me. It was just weird, I guess, looking at a professor on the screen all the time.  

**Okay. Close to wrapping up: considering everything we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

I do. I still am trying to do the best job of learning from this. And I've talked about how I think failure kind of follows you in college, but it's kind of...with burnout, how I feel is: let's say towards those last two weeks, I feel really pressured and honestly, sometimes really annoyed, sometimes even a little bit hateful towards classes! But maybe one or two weeks after it's over, that joy kinda comes back to you. "I did it! I passed those classes! Uh, I learned cool stuff!" And you know, you struggle through it, but what I really appreciated about UofM is that everyone kinda tells you that if you're not struggling, that you're not learning. And it kinda helps? It sucks in the moment, but when it's over it feels better. Feels better when it's actually over! 

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Um, imposter syndrome, honestly, never even heard that term. I didn't know what it meant! <laugh> I feel like maybe it existed in my life and I just never honestly looked at it that way. It's kind of funny, you would think that if people make it more aware that this is a thing, imposter syndrome, then it would be less effective on you. But I feel like because people keep talking about it, it's more effective on my life. Kind of in a bad way, because I realize it's a thing, and I pay attention to it more 'cause I recognize. Where I feel like before, it's kinda like, "Oh, I get sad that someone's doing better than me", but I couldn't put a term to it, so to say, and I kinda would ignore it at times.

As to burnout, I feel like many people might agree with me: high school senior year, especially towards the end, you don't wanna do anything. You probably heard back from your college, you know where you're going, and it's like, "Why am I still here? I'm wasting my time." So it feels a little bit like burnout, like I'm dropping in energy, at least for me personally. It just kind of feels like, I just want this to be over already because your next step in life is already set, and whatever you're doing at that moment kind of feels worthless.  

**Okay. If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Oh, let's see. Honestly, if it’s going to myself. I would just say "Prepare that it's gonna suck!" <laugh> I dunno, I didn't know what to expect. It was honestly worrying coming to UofM, because my parents - I mentioned that I'm first gen, so I couldn't really ask my parents for advice and didn't really have anyone related to ask for advice. I was really worried what to expect. And my fears kind of came true, but at the same time they didn't, when I did come here. 

With imposter syndrome, it kind of felt - even when I got accepted to UofM, I still felt a little bit out of place. I felt like I was gonna be joining a group of people who were smarter than me, and I still feel like that sometimes. But at the same time, I got to learn that, you know, with like burnout, talking to other people, everyone has burnouts, even the smartest people who get 99 in every class - I dunno, there are people like that probably, to be honest! - even they feel burnout. Everybody kind of goes through it, so I shouldn't feel like I'm failing if I feel burned out by class or the whole semester entirely. 

And for imposter syndrome, just taking it with a grain of salt. I feel like UofM really pushes you to ignore it. I don't think you should ignore it completely, but don't let it get to you, you know. You are a unique person, and if you're not the best academically, there's probably something else about you that makes you special, and it's gonna help you down in life. But at the same time, if you're completely out of place, like you're not taking good care of studying and doing well in your classes, then imposter syndrome should kinda kick your ass dude, come on! You gotta, you gotta keep up, you gotta stay on track and do your work.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say?**  

No, I think I've said about everything. Nice questions! Sorry about the hours, I should keep better track!  

**Nah, you're good. I think there's a lot of students who had trouble answering that because they also don't keep hours. Probably shouldn't have assumed that...**
