**As a warm up, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

So I am Californian and I went to a private school. I'm not sure exactly what to say for this, I guess...I took a lot of AP classes in high school? And, uh, I feel like I did generally pretty good in school.  

**It's open-ended, so there's not any specific thing I'm looking for. Just relevant details.**  

Okay.

**Approximately how many people do you account as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Okay. Um, interesting question. I guess I would consider everyone in the grade my peers. So it's just however big the current upcoming senior class is. I guess sometimes I would consider only computer science, but I feel like in general I would say it's just everyone in this grade.  

I mean, I take so many different classes that are not just related to computer science strictly.  

**So like, 5,000, 4,000 people?**  

Yeah, sure.  

**How many years have you been in your major?**  

Three years. 

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

I guess I decided in high school. I was going to pursue being a concert pianist, but I decided to switch it over to computer science around I would say 10th grade. Um, and that was motivated by...I was into video game development at the time, and also I took AP computer science A, which kind of motivated me because I thought it was really fun to solve all kinds of, like, computer science-y problems that are ambiguous. I don't know, problem solving was just what I liked back in high school. So I kind of just went with it, and luckily I am still enjoying the major so far.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Uh, when you say memorable, I probably think of freshman year first semester when I was working on euchre. That was the first big challenge coming to college. It was mostly because I procrastinated until there were only three days until it was due, and I kind of wanted to, uh, prove to my friends that I could complete it within three days. So I remember all the moments that went into it, including not really sleeping too much, just going at it in the Couzens computer lab...yeah, it just stood out because it was a fun challenge.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

It kind of differs a lot, depending on which year I'm talking about. So for example, freshman year, I want to say outside of lectures, probably 10 to 20 hours per week. Sophomore year, I took more rigorous classes, and also that includes 370 and 376, which I wasn't particularly good at. Also during COVID, it was harder to understand the lectures during class time, and I had to compensate with extra time outside of class. That was probably around 20 to 30 hours. If a particular project is harder, then I'll probably spend a little bit more time to debug it. But junior year, I took mostly more chill classes, so I didn't have to spend too much outside of class again. So I would say that's also around 10 to 20.  

**Okay. Similar question: what is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester?**  

I'll just go with last year. I would say it's around, uh - I was gonna say 40, but it might be too much. So let's go with 30 to 40?  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Yeah, probably sophomore year. Busiest was...I don't know. I just didn't really rest much. 'cause I rested probably 2 hours per day, that are not thinking about my project. And those are during cooking. So yeah.  

**So number of work hours would be.**..?  

It would be like...10 to 12...let's go with 60? Let's just go around 60 or 70.  

**And you said average number of hours you got per week in your busiest semester was two per day, right?**  

Oh, I thought you said week!  

**Oh no, no, no. Sorry, because you said it was two per-**

Yeah that's during like the, the busiest week, not the busiest semester.  

**Ah, okay. So busiest semester was...was what you said earlier? Sorry. I'm forgetting stuff.**

I am also forgetting your question.  

**Small brain memory. Oh god. Um.**  

If you want busiest working hours average for the busiest semester, we can just go with...40.  

**Okay. And then rest hours per week for that semester?**  

Making me calculate a lot in my head! <laugh> Oh, let's see. You're talking about waking rest again, right?

**Yes.**  

Okay. Uh, let's just go with 35 I guess.  

**Okay. Then next question: what is the most number of hours you worked in a single week? You said 60 already, right?**  

Yeah, yeah.  

**Can you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Sure. I'm getting up at 9:00 AM and entering office hour queue while trying to figure out my problem until 10:30, when I get into office hours, and then continuing debugging until 1:00 PM, and then eating lunch and then doing other homework that's not CS...and then working on code again from let's say 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM and then walking over to another area to call my teammates. And I remember that Monday we worked from 6:00 PM to 2:00 AM, where I decided to give up on that day and just sleep and the next day being kind of similar.  

**I see.**  

**How much control do you have over how you spend your time?**  

How much control do I have?...pretty good control. I try to plan out my day, usually. Um, I rely- *intense coughing* Sorry, I'm choking on protein powder.  

**I see. Dangerous.**  

Yes. Uh, but yeah, I mean, I heavily use Google Calendar to mark all the necessary things, and every morning I would look at it to see roughly what else I want to do during the times I didn't mark. So I would say I have pretty good pretty.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

I think my overall enthusiasm level increased as I took more upper-level classes, because the classes were more within my interests. So as opposed to the lower level ones, where a lot of the time I would think to myself "This shouldn't be a part of the requirements", "Why am I taking this, I'm not interested in it and I will never use it". So upper level classes I would say honestly increased my enthusiasm level a lot.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**

I think it's roughly about the same, but I do feel like it's decreasing a little bit. Just because I want to get work done faster so I can do other things.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

I think it's been increasing. Not by too much, but it's been increasing. Like it's been going from...first semester was a few Bs, and now it's mostly As. But that could also be because I'm taking easier classes.  

**Okay. Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Hmm, good question. I feel like I...I make a lot of short term goals that I write on my whiteboard. It ranges from things like, for example, filling out an application sometime this week to my long term goals, for example, becoming more fit and more healthy, eating habits, stuff like that. Or for example, getting an internship, or stuff like that. I try my best to complete them, and the long term goals are definitely harder than the short term goals, just because I don't think about them that much. I feel like if I think about them more frequently, it might help?

Yeah. I don't know. Short term goals are just so much easier for me to complete, and I usually complete them all simply because it's like, the gratitude that I feel when I check something off my whiteboard. Like "Orca, you're doing something right", and the satisfaction is good.  

**In your education before UofM - and I think you kind of touched on this already - were you a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yeah, I would say so. I was in all the advanced classes, and I was getting all As, so yes.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**

No, not really. I just kind of accept that some of my other peers, um, just have more expertise in a certain field. So I don't really feel pressured, I just kind of accept it.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

I would say I embrace it most of the time pretty well. In high school, one of my teachers really focused on having a growth mindset and treating failure as something that you can grow from, and at the time I thought it was really cringy and I wanted him to stop every time. But I feel like he has drilled it down to me where it's kind of within how I think too, so I believe that comparing to a lot of my other peers, I tend to think more positively of failures. It still sucks when you encounter a failure, but I think I have a pretty good mindset when it comes to it most of the time.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Uh, it makes me happy, of course. It's always nice to have compliments. It motivates me to go a little harder.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**

Happiness? And usually a desire to continue the success feeling, so yeah, same as last question. Just feeling more motivated.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

Well it depends on the person, because I've definitely seen people who are more on the spiteful spectrum, of not being happy when they see other people succeed. But there's also a lot of other people - I feel like most of my friends are happy when I succeed, and then it makes me happy and more comfortable too.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes, I have.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Very tired, every day, and an extreme lack of - it's not even like motivation necessarily, because for example, when I encounter burnout, it's not like I'm not motivated to get to class. It's just mentally, I'm kind of gone.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**

I have.

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Feeling like you don't belong for a certain - it could be anything. Community, a class, or it can also be relating to success, when you achieve a certain level of success; you could still feel like you don't deserve it.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**

Yeah.  

**How so?**  

Usually it's towards the end of the semester when I just feel so sick of doing schoolwork and would rather do anything else in that moment. For example, last semester, I would say the last two or three weeks, I was like, I haven't had a break in so long and I'd rather have more social interactions or even work on my own projects. I feel like my brain was just so tired of doing the same thing of schoolwork for so long.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah. Not too much. To elaborate, for example, at my last internship or at the beginning of my current one - at the beginning of both. I kind of felt like I was the only one that didn't really know how to do something. But it doesn't really last very long at all for me, because I just convinced myself that I belonged there and that, uh, it's normal.  

**Okay.**

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I feel like it's pretty prevalent. Of course, it varies on the degree of burnout that they feel, but I kind of believe that everyone feels that to some degree. Just burning out to some degree at the end of the semester. I haven't really met many people at all that don't feel it.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

It's definitely harder for me to gauge because people don't really talk about imposter syndrome much when they're feeling it, right? So I believe that it definitely is there, especially within UMich. I've talked to people who were feeling at certain points, like getting accepted to a certain grad school or any situation really. It applies to a lot of situations. I don't know how prevalent...kind of prevalent? But it could be more and I just don't know it.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Definitely worsened burnout because I feel like some professors took advantage of COVID to structure their classes or work, um, to where students feel burnout more. As far as imposter syndrome, I can see arguments for both, but I think I'm leaning towards also worsened, because students can't see each other. Since, you know, most of the time it's all camera off, so it's easier to feel that you're alone feeling a certain way.  

**Close to wrapping up: considering everything that we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yeah. I'm finding myself learning skills that, even at the time if I believe I'll never use them, I end up using it a little bit at some point. It's kind of fun just to see what I can apply my academic learnings to. 

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Not much. Imposter syndrome I honestly didn't really know much about at all, because it was never talked about in high school. Probably should have been talked about, honestly. But burning out I was kind of aware of, but also not really. I feel like at UofM, I remember the first CS class was the one that kinda introduced me to the topic.

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I don't really have any advice for imposter syndrome for myself. For burning out, I think it would've helped if my freshman year self knew how to structure time better. My time management's definitely better now, and that's also partially in response to burning out. So I would give myself some heads up.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Not much, just that it's normal to feel burnt out and that sometimes it's good to take a break and find time to just relax, even if it seems like there's no time. I mean, it's a matter of balance, right? <laugh> There's the meme about eat, rest and work - that's not the exact meme, but sometimes it's worth it to shift a little more into relaxing when you need it and less on schoolwork, even if it means that it will impact your grades or whatnot. Sometimes it is worth it.  

**Alright, thank you for your time. I shall stop recording here.**
