**Just to warm up a little bit: tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

So I mean, before coming to UofM, I just went to regular city elementary school, middle school - I will say after the eighth grade, I left the typical middle school to go to another middle school in my area where you had to test into it, and it was probably a little bit better of an education than the general middle school. And I went to that school 'cause it was eighth through twelfth grades. So I went there until I graduated high school.  

**Okay. Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Um, I mean, personally I'd say a peer is just anyone who I'm on good terms with that's also in, you know, that's also a student. So it's kind of hard to say because I tend to make a lot of friends during my classes just to make things easier. But as far as peers, I tend to not keep in close contact with too many of them afterwards. So it's kind of hard to say, but a pretty decent number. I consider them peers, but I'm not super close to most of them, if that makes sense.  

**Right. Are you able to a number on that?**  

It's really hard to put a number on...  

**Doesn't have to be like an exact number.**  

Okay. Definitely like 30...That's a really low estimate. But most of those people aren't in my program though. Those people that aren't in my program are CS majors or something else.  

**Okay. Gotcha. How many years have you been in your major?**  

Um, two years. I declared the beginning of my sophomore year, so that's two academic years.  

**Okay. And what is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

So when I was in high school, one of my professors mentioned actuarial sciences - which is not what I'm doing, but it kind of got me thinking. Then I think it was...honestly, I got really lucky because I didn't really look into it. I just kind of thought, "IOE is kind of like that, and I kind of wanna do that", so I declared and I thought to myself, "I would change if I wanted to change my major afterwards". But since then, I mean - my personal mentor actually has an IOE degree, so I talked to her about things, and I just found myself loving it. So I got kind of lucky 'cause I didn't know all that much about what I was gonna get myself into. I was going to declare for CS...I don't honestly have a huge reason why I didn't. However, I realize now that not doing CS was good for me, because the screen time tends to give me migraines. So I can't really code for super long at any given time.

**Okay. What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

I feel like this is a story that most people have, but my first class that I took at UofM, the first class I had the first day of my first year, was physics 140X. And um, I did not do as well as I wish I did. It kind of told me that I needed to treat this differently than high school, because I was going in thinking I could just, you know, go in, get the grade, go out and I'd do fine. And then I started doing poorly on the exams, and I saw that the class averages were super low. And I realized I really had to take things more seriously than high school. And that's about it. It's not a particular moment, but that's something that stuck with me.  

**Okay. What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in an average semester?**  

Um, would I be including time when I'm actually in class?  

**Yeah, just time that you'd consider work and not like, whatever.**  

Um, I'd say...I'm taking like 13 credit hours usually, and then I say I spend about two hours a day on work, and I tend to work on weekends. So that's like 27-ish, maybe. That might be a bit of an overestimate, but that's roughly about it. North of 20, less than 30.  

**Okay. What's the average number of rest hours that you have in an average week for an average semester?**  

The rest hours? Honestly, I spend more time resting than I do working. I could say maybe 30.  

**Okay. What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Um, I haven't really had a busiest semester, so probably that same 27-ish. All my semesters have been pretty tame and about the same amount of work, I'd say.  

**Okay. And then average amount of rest hours would also be the same?**  

Yeah. Same deal.  

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**

Um, that's uh, hmm...maybe like full time, 40 maybe. I think that's probably the best estimate I can give.  

**Okay. Can you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Usually I do my homework on weekends, so let's say...on Sunday. If I got behind on work, I might do three or four hours of homework on that Sunday. Then during the week of course I have class. The weekend I'm thinking about in particular, I had a project for this last semester where I wanna say I spent about 7-ish hours working on this project one day, and then another five working the next day. And then after that, I did a lot of studying that probably took me three hours every other day. If memory serves, I also had one more exam to study for over the weekend. So Friday and Saturday I was also studying for my next exam. Yeah, it was just doing a project and studying, but it was a lot of studying. It took a while.  

**Okay. How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I feel like I have a lot of control, honestly. Because I feel after a certain point in high school, I kind of got it in my mind that if I work hard at a certain time, I can relax at another time. So now that I'm in college, I kind of keep that with me, and I make sure that whenever I have work that's assigned, I do it as early as I can and that I spend the rest of the time relaxing. So I mean typically, I don't really have too much work built up because I tend to do it over weekends or right after it's due. So during the week, I'm usually really free. However, when there are group assignments, that does cause me to lose a little bit of control, because I also need to worry about when other people can be doing their work. Typically, people wouldn't wanna work on weekends or late at night, and so I might be held up, and I might lose control there. Typically a lot of control is just based on doing things early and not waiting until the deadline.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, yes. When I first came to UofM, I was just kind of coasting. I knew I wanted a degree, I didn't really care about...doing too great? I figured, you know, as long as I get As and Bs and a decent GPA, I'll graduate and that'll be that. Then after I declared IOE - I think it was just this last year - I started taking classes, and I started to really enjoy some of the classes. I started to really think about what I wanted to do in my future after I graduated. And I decided that I wanted to get a master's degree in particular. Since taking a few classes I really liked and then deciding I wanted to get a master's, I've kind of shifted gears. Before that I was taking things just as they came, wasn't really enjoying them, just wanted the degree. But now I'm talking to faculty, trying to do research, trying to get a job, talking to advisors, thinking about grad school, talking to my professors...and it's definitely a completely different way of thinking from when I first came to college.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, yeah. I feel like when you're a freshman, you just want to go everywhere and do everything. Then after a year or two, when your classes are getting difficult, all you wanna do is not do work, and you just sit around a lot more. You don't hang out with people every single night, you're not always everywhere doing everything. So yeah, I mean, after my sophomore - well after my freshman year - when I came back to campus for my junior year, I was definitely a lot less energetic, and I wasn't always going out and doing things. I was just doing my own thing. Yeah.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

I mean, yes and no. When I first came in that first semester, it wasn't great because I took physics. And after that, I took calc two and calc three at UofM, and you know, those aren't the easiest classes, so I didn't do too well on those. My other classes all went fine. It's really hard to say as well, because of COVID changing how we all interact with classes and classmates. So I mean, it's kind of hard to say. I would say probably since I started enjoying my classes, I've been doing better, but it's hard to say how much of me doing better is due to me finally being in person and being with classmates, versus how much of it is due to how classes were before and how I'm actually feeling about my classes. If that makes sense.  

**Alright, shifting gears: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

My goals are typically just to do my work by a certain day, and as long as I finish everything I had planned for the day, I consider that goal complete. Typically grades and exams kind of fall under the same "having the work done and having this studying done". When you're doing it all on time, typically the grades just kind of fall alongside that. So I'd say my goals are all really realistic, because it's just finish this at this time and by the end of the day, or respond to this email in the morning and just kind of go through my to-do list.  

And it's very rare that I don't finish everything I wanted to do in one day. In those rare cases, I just do it the next day. So I'm very successful in meeting my goals. Grades-wise, a bit less successful, but more or less the same deal. Um, yeah.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yeah, I was top of my high school. I took every AP class, I had one grade on my transcript that wasn't an A, everyone kinda knew me as a smart kid. Alongside two of my good friends who were class rank two and three, we were all just the smart kids. That was up until college.  

**Okay. Do you or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Um, yeah. Personally, I take fewer credits per semester just for the sake of relaxing and having time to take care of myself.

But a lot of times...I mean, there are events every other day, and there are emails you get every day, and you wanna, you know, reply to them all. You want to go to everything. You wanna go and hang out with friends, but there's always something to do, and you feel like you should be doing everything. But you never know how to. Say I have a lot of homework to do one day, but there's career fair. I don't know, I could put the homework off or I could try to do the homework as quick as I can, or I could not go to the career fair. That actually happened to me this last semester, where I was in class one day and the teacher mentioned that the career fair was going on that same day.  

And I had not known about it until then, because the emails kind of passed by me, but I also had two other classes during that same time and homework. So it wasn't really feasible for me to leave classes, start preparing, and then go to the career fair. And whenever you talk to someone and they say "I got a response from this company or that company", there's always that feeling that you get thinking, "I should have applied. I should have gotten this research job. I should have done this on top of my classes." And it can definitely be hard thinking that "I'm already doing so much and I'm already stressed - I'm so stressed out - I'm already worrying about how I'm doing, but these people are doing so much more than I am, and it feels like I'm not doing enough".  

**Okay. What is your relationship with failure?**  

Prior to the end of high school, I very rarely if ever got anything less than a B on a test. So it really wasn't a thing in my life. Then when I came to college, I took physics and I started failing these exams. And it didn't hurt as badly then, but ever since I decided that I wanted to get a master's degree, every time that I get a test or homework back and it's not at least a strong B, it genuinely hurts because I'm thinking that "I need to get this GPA. I need to do this program. I need to be competitive." And I keep thinking, you know, "This B- or this C+ isn't master's degree potential, this isn't graduate school work". And so it's definitely hurt a lot more, since I've decided that I wanted to do more after I graduated.  

And every time I talk to friends - I have a lot of friends who are not trying to do graduate school or any program after they graduate. So they focus a lot on just passing their classes. They're calculating their grades, or what they need so that they can get a C in the class and get the credit. And it always feels so weird and borderline unfair to me, just because I'm sitting here worrying about having to get a 90% in this class, just so my GPA can stay up. And they're feeling that all they need to get in this class is a 50%.

Yeah. That's about it.  

**Okay. How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Usually, um, I'd say...just being an IOE major, everyone loves to say that IOE is easy. And I won't say that I agree or disagree with that, but it's definitely rubbed off on me a little bit, where I think to myself, "Oh, this the IOE curriculum, it would be bad if I didn't get this good grade or if I didn't have this high class average here". And I think, "Oh, if I was a CS student, I'd be getting solid Bs in every class. So I downplay it personally. Between the curriculum that I'm in and the curriculums that I'm not in, I'm really only doing so well because I've taken the easier courseload. And that on top of only taking 13 credits a semester, I just don't really feel like I deserve most academic praise.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

It feels like success is expected when you go to a university like this. It feels like A is average, B is below average. So when I think about success, it is kind of hard to consider anything a success versus considering anything a failure, if that makes sense.  

Because you got an A and you think, "Okay, that was the expectation". And I mean, you did technically succeed, but at least for me it doesn't feel like you did some grand task. Versus when you get a C or below on a test, or even a B sometimes, you feel like you failed, you feel like you could have done a lot better. Even though by many metrics, a B or C can be considered a success, just coming from my background and going to this school, it really doesn't feel like a success. It feels like I'm either doing what's expected of me or I'm not what's expected of me, more than it feels like I'm succeeding or failing by any other metric. If any of that makes sense.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

Um, people who've known me for a while, they all kind of say, "Oh, you're really smart, that's kind of expected of you". And then of course there are a few people who say "Nice job in your IOE degree". Just kind of saying, "Oh, it's easy, I'd be surprised if you didn't get an A on that test", or "I'd be surprised if you didn't get an A on that exam". And definitely it doesn't feel great. Even though I joke about it as well, it doesn't feel great knowing that most people I know kind of agree that I'm taking the easier curriculum, and that when I succeed, I'm not really doing anything super difficult to do. And it definitely rubs off on me as well, so I can't say I'm blameless in the situation.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Uh, yes. Very much so.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Burnout is when you try too hard for too long and you don't have any enthusiasm. Where you don't have any energy left to give, at least for a while, so you're left running on empty for some time. But usually in situations of burnout, you don't really have the luxury of taking a break. So you're left for a while working, but you just don't have the enthusiasm, you don't have the energy, you don't have the desire; and you're sitting there day after day and you don't feel gratified. You don't feel any sort of pleasure or feelings of success, and you just feel that you want a break that you can't take.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Uh, yes.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Especially in this context, it's feeling like you don't belong where you are or feeling like you in particular are an imposter among people who are around you. So you could say, "Everyone here is super smart. They graduated from high school, came to this school, they're all really smart. But I, in particular, am not the same. I for whatever reason do not measure up to the people around me." And that's kind of the feeling that imposter syndrome centers around.

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

For me personally, no. Because I came into college with the knowledge that going for all As and going too hard on myself would only lead to burnout and a lot of undue stress. So I decided before I even started my first class that while all As would be nice and I'd definitely be trying my hardest, if I needed time to take care of myself, I would take that time. But it's another reason that I work the way that I do. And so if I need a day or two for myself, I can take that day or two for myself. So I haven't really felt burnout out very much just because I came into college with the goal of feeling good.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Um, definitely. I think we've all had the experience where the class average is a 90 and then you get a 60. And you think to yourself, "Man, I'm so far below average, it hurts". For me, I took an exam and I got my grade back immediately, and I asked on Piazza if the grade would be curved. And the professor said no, and then I saw the class average was like a 90. And I just thought to myself that, you know, I just was doing so much worse than everyone else, and I didn't belong up there. It took me all over a day to shake off that feeling, 'cause I was just taken over by it for a little while.  

**Do you believe any of your peers have experienced burnout? If so, how prevalently do you see it?**  

So most of the people that I hang around are CS majors, and I feel like they in particular are especially vulnerable to feeling burnout because their projects take so long. It feels like every time I'm with someone who's a CS major, they're just talking about how much they don't want to do their work and how much they don't wanna be in college and how much they are just done with their curriculum, done with the faculty. And they just hate every second of being at UofM. Even though they might like what they're doing, just the constant flow of projects and the constant low grades on exams just make them feel super burnt out. It's as soon as the semester begins and doesn't stop until the summer. As far as people who aren't in CS, I've noticed it definitely less, but it's still prevalent, especially around exam time. 

**Do you believe any of your peers have experienced imposter syndrome? And if so, how prevalently do you see that?**  

I feel like it's more prevalent than one would think, just because people tend not to voice those feelings. I feel like in general, if someone's feeling that way, they just wouldn't say it. But I've definitely noticed people thinking they don't belong at UofM for one reason or another. It's definitely less common than people just feeling burnt out. And I see on like, the subreddit, or I see through emails that people are trying to address the topic of imposter syndrome. And there are lots of people who feel that way, but people don't talk about it nearly as often. So it's hard to judge how prevalent it is, at least from my eyes.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

When you're all on your own sitting in your parents' house, it's really hard to tell how anyone else is feeling. I mean, everyone else is just a talking head. Like you get in the lab, you talk to this guy, maybe he has a camera on, maybe he doesn't. And they hardly even feel like people, so it's hard to tell what anyone else is feeling about anything. But you can feel terrible, you can feel like, super burnt out, you can feel like you have nothing left to give and that you're running on empty. It's hard to tell where anyone else is, and that kind of feeds into imposter syndrome where it seems everyone else just does their work, they submit, they have no problem with it, and you're just the odd one out. Because you're the only person you know who is going through these sorts of feelings. Even if you can reason that at least some other people are feeling the same way, you have no way of knowing, because all your peers were just little boxes on Zoom at that point. Especially because I don't have too many friends who are in my major, so most of the time I only had one or two people who I could talk to about coursework. And if I'm the only one of the three people who I talk to who are feeling burned out about work, I definitely feel like I'm the odd one out there.  

**Close to the end of the interview - considering everything that we've talked about, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Depending on the class, very much so. I like some classes more than others, but I can say in general I do enjoy my academic work.It's nice when you're not doing so much and  you have enough time to focus on each one individually and appreciate them for what they are. Versus if you have a lot of classes and you're constantly just going between one and another and another, and you don't have time to appreciate them or enjoy the finer details of the class.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Um, not at all. I mean of course people felt burned out with schoolwork, but at the end of the day you either did it or you didn't. It wasn't super complicated, and the work wasn't that hard. You could just copy it from a friend - which I didn't do, but most people I knew wouldn't do homework until the school day and copy it during lunch or something. And they all got away with it, so when we all went home, most of us just started relaxing. So I didn't feel like it was the same burnout where you were constantly doing work and you just didn't have any energy left to give, but more like you didn't have any motivation to begin doing the work. And as far as imposter syndrome...in my city, there are at least two high schools.  

So two big high schools, one where you test into - and that's where I went - and one that's for the general public. We all kind of thought to ourselves that we were too smart for the other high school, we were smarter than the kids who went there, and so we did belong where we were. Because the other high school - we would joke a lot, and I mean, it's not a bad school at all. But it's very much a different sort of experience than the one that I went to, and academically it was a lot less simulating from what I understand. So we all knew that we didn't belong there, so we had to belong here. If that makes sense.

**Okay. If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Honestly I wouldn't say too much, because I came in knowing how to avoid burnout for my own standards and for my own work ethic. Imposter syndrome isn't something that I felt too much up until everyone started doing their own courses. I asked an IOE guy I knew at the time about the major, and I kind of saw these class averages and I saw my grades; and I started feeling, very occasionally, that I didn't belong. But honestly, neither have been a massive issue, just because I've been managing burnout and imposter syndrome. To me the feelings only ever last a few days at most.  

**Is there anything you'd like to say?**  

Um, I can say...this is kind of hard to articulate just in the context of this interview, but I know that you mentioned a survey about demographics. So I can probably add a little bit about my experience as far as how I personally identified before I got into UofM, which might be a little bit helpful. 

I come from metro Detroit. The city I came from is mostly African-Americans, and so coming into UofM, it's a different kind of imposter syndrome. It's honestly borderline even the same thing, but it's hard to look at a classroom and not see anyone who looks like you and then feel like you belong. You just kind of feel like, "I am not the same as everyone else", especially coming from a place where almost everyone's African-American. Coming into UofM and, you know, having to look for anyone who looks like you definitely can make you feel like you don't belong. I know that's the reason why so many people from my high school decided they didn't even want to come to this school in the first place. Because they knew that they'd be getting that feeling, and they just didn't wanna deal with it. Which is only, I guess, tangentially related to the interview. But I think that might be useful information.  

Questions along that of thought I can answer, but that's about all I wanted to say.

**Questions for that train of thought...I sort of wrote questions for like, a general, um, audience, I guess. Most of my interviewee group is ethnically white or Asian, which I believe are the two largest minority groups - um, two largest ethnic groups here at Michigan. This is important, it's just that I don't have questions written down. Alright, let's see....so you mentioned that you came from Metro Detroit with a largely African-American population.** 

Yeah.

**And you came to a university where that is not the case.**

Yeah. Back at home, there are maybe a handful of people who aren't African-American, and then you flip and you come here and it's the complete opposite, where there are only a handful of people who are African-American. Relatively speaking of course.  

**A handful. So, um, do you have an approximate number on, like, how many African Americans you see, um, in your day to day? And how many African Americans you count among your peers?**  

As far as classes go, when I'm usually just going about my business - in each of my classes, depending on the size of the class, I'd say maybe one or two people who are African-American per 20 or 30 people, maybe. So that's usually one per class, maybe two. In bigger lecture halls, of course there are more; but I think proportion-wise it's about the same. And I'm not counting people in other ethnic groups - I'm only focused here on African-Americans - but as far as my peers go a lot more than...okay. So because my high school is so close by, a lot of people from my high school just came to UofM. So that's in many ways the foundation of people who I hung around with. So relatively speaking, I could say that I talk to a lot more African Americans, and I consider a lot more African Americans friends than I should proportion-wise. It definitely does not match that general proportion of African Americans at UofM; those demographics are very much not the same.  

**Just a check: how big are your classes, just for context?**  

Um, maybe 25 to 40 kids. I mean, of course there are bigger classes, but all in all, usually when I look around, I see one or two other African Americans in a standard classroom.  

**Mm-hmm. Do you believe your ethnicity affects how, um, how your peers see you?**  

Um, typically no. There's always at least one person who kind of sees you as the black friend, but that's not at all the majority. Usually people just treat me as is, and they treat me like anyone else. However, growing up, I definitely heard a lot of people outright warn me about coming to a school like UofM, saying that people would view me as less than other people just because of the color of my skin. And I've had substitute teachers come in and warn me about people of other races, basically, if I wanna go to that school. I try not to hold onto it, but it's hard to not have that gnawing at the back of your mind every once in a while. You just always think that there might be maybe one person in this room who's thinking this or that about you, and even though you really don't wanna believe it and you don't wanna think about it, sometimes it's kind of inevitable. Especially when...I don't have a group of friends in my major who share my ethnicity, who are in the same classes as me. So I'm usually on my own, and you definitely feel a certain way when you're on your own like that.  

It's not usually a problem. At least in my mind - it might be that for some people, it's only ever a problem if you think about it too hard, or you really kind of hang onto what these people have told you years ago. There are so many different groups on campus that just all focused on making people feel included and making people feel like they're not the only ones of their ethnicity or race at UofM, and those groups are great. They help a lot of people, and I've gone to some meetings for them and it is really nice. It almost makes me feel like I'm back home again. But not everyone's in those groups, and I'm sure there's at least one person who is in those groups and feels like there are people judging them all the time. There's gotta be at least one person feeling like that. 

Take your time. I'm thinking of anything else that might be useful as you're thinking of questions. 

**Okay. I'm not sure on the wording of this question, but do you find that thinking about or being conscious about your ethnicity, uh, and sort of your place within the university - do you find that takes energy or attention away from academic matters?**  

Away from academic matters? No. Away from just your energy, yeah. Especially now that things are online or at least partially online...when I'm at home, I'm not really thinking about that. But say I'm just walking around campus or I'm just doing my thing - sometimes it might come up in my mind. Especially as someone who's not only African-American, but particularly Nigerian, it definitely comes to mind. And I might think like I really don't know that many other Nigerians on campus, or I don't know that many other people who kind of share the same upbringing as myself. But because I do know many people who are from my high school, many of whom did have the same upbringing as myself, it doesn't really take too much energy for me, because I have those people who I can feel that kind of connection to. But I can definitely feel that if someone didn't have that support, it could feel taxing on them. It could build on whatever stress they're feeling, their academics, especially when you're not doing well.  

**Okay. I'm seeing this as someone who, like, doesn't have this perspective as an African American. Do you find that there are stereotypes or, um, social implications, um - like stereotypes or social implications that are applied to you as a student or someone in academia?**  

Yeah, so occasionally, very occasionally someone will assume based off of my name, especially - they'll assume that I'm a certain way. And they'll ask me questions about something that I don't really know the answers to. UI mean, so in academia it hasn't really come up as often. More than anything, it's occasionally people ask me either information that they assume I know or people ask me for my opinion about something, and many times someone will kind of break a full conversation in a group and say, "Hey, as a black male, how do you feel about this topic?" And I mean, there's a lot more of that in casual conversation. But you definitely do feel a lot of pressure to represent that entire race of people a certain way.  

As far as actual academics and research and careers and all that, I haven't really felt very much of an impact. The biggest thing that I can think of is that for many people, you can feel really weird about talking to your professors or GSI sometimes. I know a lot of people who just don't go to office hours or refuse to keep asking questions; but I know for a fact that if their professor, you know, looked more like them, they'd be perfectly fine with showing up and being more friendly and asking questions and hanging around office hours. And that can definitely be a huge thing for a lot of people, when they don't feel comfortable asking questions, especially not in-person. Because that's pretty important.  

Other questions that you'd like me to answer?

**Yeah. I think I'll probably stop there for now, cause I mean, 1. I have other things to do, but 2. I also think if I'm gonna ask more questions, I want to do a bit more research on how burnout and imposter syndrome interplay with ethnicity. Because I have heard reports that imposter syndrome and burnout are accentuated in particularly underrepresented groups.** 

**And I think...'cause what I've read is that - and I think you mentioned this - there's sort of a pressure to represent your ethnicity. And also if you are a trailblazer and there's not a lot of other people who are like you, then there's less of a support network. I think that's what I've read. I haven't really dug deep into it though.**  

Yeah. I could definitely say those are probably two of the biggest things. There's also...there's this very quiet, bit of a nagging feeling of not wanting to perpetuate any stereotypes, just as you go about your daily life. That can be a bit irritating, but it's not - at least for me, it's not a huge, huge issue. But yeah, if you have more questions later, I can definitely talk to you about it.  

**Anything else on the topic before you want to wrap up?**  

Nothing else comes to mind.  

**All right, cool. I'll stop recording there then.**
