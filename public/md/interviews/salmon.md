**Tell me a little bit about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

I went to a high school in Michigan, did basic high school stuff, like AP and a little bit of dual enrollment at a local community college and university as well.

**Approximately how many people did you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

How many? Maybe 200, 250 maybe is the range? 

**That seems like quite a lot. How did that come about?**  

Well, I was on IA [instructional aide] staff for two different classes. That added together is already 50. Then I also have friends that I know in CS, maybe another 50. Counting other friends outside of CS, I know a lot of people through my church too, maybe like another hundred. Just a guess, I guess.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your major?**  

Four.  

**And what's the story of you deciding on your major?**  

I decided pretty early freshman year. I basically knew I wanted to do CS when I came in. I did a little bit of coding in high school and I liked it - AP CS and stuff - and then I also hung out with people who did math through my dual enrollment, and CS seemed cool and I wanted to learn about it. So I just came in taking 280 directly, and then I liked it - so I decided to continue. I just liked it because it was sort of an intersection between engineering and math. And I liked the fact that you could build something on your computer, which is pretty cool. So yeah, just went straight into it.  

**Okay. What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Um, what timeframe? Over a semester, or like one thing that happened?  

**It can be whatever, I'm just looking for interesting stories here.**  

Okay, let's see. I think I pulled an all-nighter before my 370 exam. That was very hard. I almost fell asleep and almost missed the exam. Yeah. I can't really think of anything else.  

**Gotcha. What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

Uh, let's see. It really depends on the semester, but I'd say the first three years - so my undergrad - I'd say it was maybe 30 hours a week to 40, 30 to 40. Yeah. And then in grad school, it would be more like 5 to 10, maybe. 

**For that same average semester, what was the average amount of rest time that you got per week? However you define rest - include sleep in here as well, I guess.**  

Include sleep...So if it includes sleep, I'd say I got I think eight hours a day. Eating and stuff probably takes up another two hours. So 10 hours, and then miscellaneous stuff, like another four hours. I'd say like 14 hours a day, at least. Maybe 70 to 80 hours a week.  

**Okay. Uh, apologies here since you are the first person that I interviewed since my demo run last week, I think it actually makes more sense if I don't ask you to include sleep hours here.**  

Oh, okay? Then...wait, what did I say? There's seven days in a week, so maybe like I'd say...yeah, I'd say around five hours, five hours a day. So I'd say 35 to 45 maybe.  

**Okay. I'm gonna ask a similar question about your busiest semester. So what was the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Yeah. Busiest semester...oh gosh, I had many busy semesters. I'd say fall of 2019, so my sophomore year. I was taking EECS 381, and I actually tracked the hours I spent on VS Code. I think just on that one class alone, I spent like 60 to 100 hours per project. And the projects were two weeks long, so total I'd say like, 55 hours a week.  

**Okay. And then for that semester, what was your average number of rest hours per week?**  

Rest hours? Yeah. Um, gosh, maybe like 20 hours. Around three hours a day, eating and walking around and stuff.  

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in one single week?**  

Most number of hours I worked in one single week...probably like a hundred hours, also working on a 381 project or something like that.  

**Okay. Would you mind talking a little bit more about that week and what that looked like?**  

Maybe not 100, that's a bit unrealistic. 14 hours a day...20 hours? Yeah. Okay, I don't think it's actually 100, maybe 80 - I'd say 80. But I'd say it was around the time when I had the final project for EECS 381, it was just a lot of coding. You also had to prepare a report for your design and print out all your code and highlight all the parts of your code that pertain to your design and stuff. So it was a lot, and the last night I think I stayed up with my partner until 4:00 AM in the UGLI [Shapiro undergraduate library], just like grinding it out. So it took basically all of my time, I'd say.  

**How much control did you feel you had over how you spent your time at UofM?**  

I think I had a lot of control. I could do what I wanted to do. I mean, I work, but I feel like I had control where and when to do that work, and how much effort I wanted to put into it.

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, let's see. Yeah, I think it was pretty high for freshman, sophomore year and still pretty high junior year. And then in grad school it kind of dropped. Wasn't too enthusiastic about academics.  

I guess you call that senioritis. <laugh> Yeah.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Mm, overall energy level? Freshman year, my energy level was pretty low. And also sophomore year and first semester of junior year. I think after that, it probably trended higher.  

**Okay. Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, I think it got better since freshman year, but that was mostly because I was getting bad grades in math classes my freshman year and I stopped taking math classes. But for CS, I think it's been about the same the whole time. Maybe gotten a little bit better.  

**Now going a little bit in a different direction with the questions: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Um, let's see. I think they're pretty realistic, and I think I accomplish them most of the time. I mean, for example, during the summers, I normally set some goals of reading some books in a certain amount of time. And I typically finish reading those books.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or especially strong student?**  

Yeah. Well, my school had this thing at the end of senior year where they picked like five students to represent the school, who are, I guess, the best academically. I was one of the five. So I think I was - like, I had perfect GPA until the last semester and took a bunch of AP classes. So I think I was up there.

**Did you ever feel pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Superhuman...  

**Yeah, pressure to do more than what is expected of a normal student?**  

I don't think so.  

**Okay. What is your relationship with failure?**  

Failure? I think I've considered myself to fail in, well, when I got bad grades and in math classes when I didn't really understand anything that was going on. But I think I view failure as...I don't regret it as long as I feel like I gave my best effort. And I always try to make it at least a learning experience that makes me stronger. So I think I'm not afraid of it as much. It's just about how much effort I put into it.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Academic praise? I mean, I normally try to smile and nod and maybe deflect it a little bit. I don't know. <laugh> I mean, I acknowledge that I've done well academically, but I don't want it to be a huge, like, I don't wanna be prideful about it. I don't want it to be like the singular part of my identity that people see. So I think I acknowledge it, but I don't like...I dunno, I guess that's it. Yeah.  

**Okay. What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

I feel like I'm happy, thankful that things worked out...yeah. A sense of satisfaction for being able to achieve something.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I think they're happier for me, and I think it's generally not negative at least. Depends on how close I am with them, how much they care. 

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Burnout is when you work and do the same thing over and over again for a period of time, and you start getting tired of it, and you don't really find the same motivation that you used to do the thing anymore.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Yeah. Imposter syndrome is where you feel you don't belong or deserve what you have? Yeah, you don't feel like you belong in a group of people or where you're studying or, you know, wherever you are, you feel like you don't belong. Yeah. That's probably my definition.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah, I think so. Yeah.  

**Okay. Could you describe some of your experiences with burnout?** 

Yeah. I think during COVID, during fall 2020, I was taking four EECS classes in the fall. And typically by November or December I kind of want to get stuff over with and not have to worry about it anymore. It was hard to...also, I think a big factor in it was I wasn't really exercising, and I just spent the whole day in my room and didn't really get any fresh air or exercise and didn't really see that many people either. So I just felt lethargic every day, started wasting a lot of time on my phone, whether it was playing games or YouTube, and that just made me feel even more lazy or useless - uh, not useless, but like lazy and, you know, not being productive. And it just was a period of general tiredness, and I didn't really feel like I was living life to the fullest, I guess. 

**Did you have any other experiences?**  

Yeah, I think every semester it happens a little bit near the end, where I would just wanna get done with classes and stuff. I think another semester where it happened was when I was taking my senior design project and machine learning - 545 - at the same time, and near the end, it was a lot of work trying to wrap up the senior design project, trying to like, finish up that 545 project. And I didn't really like my project, so I just wanted to get stuff over with. Also, having Zoom meetings all the time was very tiring. So I think I got a little burned out. I was also an IA for a class and holding office hours online for three hours twice a week, which is also pretty tiring.    

**Mm-hmm. Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**

Huh. No, I don't think so. Maybe. Okay, maybe a couple times in high school when I, like, had these math competitions that I went to, and everybody else knew so much more than me at these math competitions, and I felt like I just did not know what was going on and didn't really fit in. But other than that, I don't think I have.  

**Just curious, do you believe there is a reason that you've managed to mostly avoid imposter syndrome in college?**  

Well, let me think. I mean, I try to focus more on what I'm doing, and I try not to let other people's opinions of me influence me. Like if I see the value in what I'm doing myself and I know that I'm learning and I feel like I'm learning and I'm growing - I enjoy that. I enjoy learning, I enjoy going to class. And if I can feel all those things myself, then I don't see a reason for other people's view of me to affect me. Because you know, at the end of the day, what matters is that I'm learning and growing, and if I feel like I'm learning and growing, then I don't let what other people may think of me affect me. 

Okay, but another time I got imposter syndrome definitely was in math class though. Like freshman year, the math class. I did not do too hot, because I wasn't feeling like I was learning and growing. I was completely lost in the class, and I felt like other people knew what was going on. So I think I probably had some imposter syndrome there. Like I didn't fit in with the honors math students.  

**Okay. How prevalent do you think burnout is among your peers?**  

Pretty prevalent. I'd say most people I know probably experience it to some extent.  

**Okay, curious - and you don't have to answer if you don't know much or if you wanna keep things private for other people - but any details from others' stories that you've seen?**  

No, not really. It's mostly - like I said, near the end of the semester, if I'm working on a project with other people, people have a similar sentiment to me that they just want to get stuff done and are getting tired of projects and stuff. But no particular stories.  

**Similar question for imposter syndrome: how prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

I'd say it probably exists, but I'd say...my guess is that maybe 15% to 20% of my peers feel that way. So not a huge percentage, but also not nothing.  

**Same pattern here too -- any stories or details, if appropriate?**

Yeah, I was a GSI for an introductory CS course this past semester. We've seen a lot of Piazza posts of people feeling like they don't understand the material, or they don't feel like they're good enough to learn discrete math. So I think for me, the places I've seen it the most are introductory CS courses where students haven't really developed a track record of succeeding in CS classes yet. So they feel less confident, especially if they're not getting the material, which is hard to grasp at first. Then it can be easy to get discouraged. So yeah, I think in general, that's where I see it happen the most. 

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah, the pandemic made me realize I definitely need to take care of myself to avoid burnout. Like I said, I got burned out fall 2020 of COVID, and one thing I did after that semester was start to have a habit of exercising every day. I would go run a mile every single day, and the next semester I think was much better because of that, because I had 15 minutes of exercise that I committed to. So I think the pandemic made me realize exercise is important, that exercise in particular is important for taking care of myself and avoiding burnout.  

**Some closing questions: considering everything we've talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work here?**  

Yeah, I did enjoy my academic work at UofM.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Not that much, actually. I don't think I really knew about it or cared about it.  

**Mm-hmm. If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

So advice...Yeah, I'd say, find enjoyment in your learning. Because I think if you do that, then you can really see the purpose and value in your own learning, and that helps you avoid feeling like you're an imposter. And if you're finding enjoyment, then it helps avoid burnout too. I think sometimes it's necessary too. Those periods in your life where you're working hard and really focus on something, it's not wrong to get tired or anything. But I think if you are aware, like going for a walk and having some exercise can go a long way in those situations. And also just having good study habits. Starting projects early can help you avoid the burnout that can come from grinding something out as well.  

**Anything else you'd like to say?**  

Um, no.

**All right, Cool. Thank you for participating in this interview.**
