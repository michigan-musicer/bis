**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Well, I grew up in New York City, and it's interesting because there are some very, very good high schools and some not so good high schools - and this goes for all levels of education. I was able to go to one of the very big specialized high schools. There's around 6,000 students in total for all grades, and it's very competitive to get into the school. So I guess that competitive nature built me up for Michigan a little.  

And for elementary and middle schools, the New York education system is very good overall, and I had good education at those ages.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Magnitude-wise, it's tricky, because I'm very picky with my peers. It's the difference between acquaintances and friends on Facebook, where really the only people I add as friends are people that I really interact with. I'd say for peers that I interact with, around 50-ish between different organizations and clubs. I wouldn't say my housemates are academic peers, more just friends. I guess depending on how you define peers, you could extend that to people in group meetings, classes, teams you work on projects with, et cetera.  

**Hmm, okay. How many years have you been in your major?**  

I've stayed in it the entire time. So I declared it between freshman and sophomore year to now, so around two or so years. Though I don't know if this should count, but at my high school there were specialized classes, and I did electrical engineering there also. Including that would be around five years. But just for college, around three years.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Yeah, so a lot of it is from my high school. They make you lock in your electives early because it's such a big school. Even in middle school - because my high school is a very well known, very good school - there was this STEM program. The idea is that in New York, getting into the specialized high schools requires you to take a middle school version of the SAT; it's really hard to get in for a lot of people, because if you don't have the right resources or you went to one of the worse schools - since in New York, the schools are de facto segregated - if you went to one of the schools that didn't give you the prep, it's really hard to get in, and vice versa for the good schools.

So though I went to a good middle school, I went into the program to learn more about STEM, and the people who ran those programs were teachers at my high school, and they got me introduced to electrical engineering, like circuit design and other basic stuff. From there, I went along to really like it and engineering as a whole.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Time at UofM? That's tricky. By academics, do you mean just classes or also project teams and extracurriculars?  

**You can count the outside stuff too, whatever you would consider academic work.**

Okay. The thing about my experience at UofM - I'll get to this later, as it has contributed to my burnout - is that due to COVID, a lot of the things I was about to finish or would've gotten done did not get done. My big crowning achievement would've been finishing up this big laser spectroscopy project in my sophomore year. That didn't go great, because my project kind of fell apart. I guess it's a big accomplishment that one of my extracurricular project teams just got first place at a big competition - that was really rewarding. I guess that's my big academic "big thing", but there's a couple of other things related to research and project teams that, if COVID didn't hit, would've been even greater accomplishments.  

**What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in an average semester?**  

That's really hard. Some semesters I'm taking Math 217 - and that's an L - and other semesters, at least in junior year, I've tried to be more relaxed. I'd want to put the number around 60-ish, but it really depends on the year and the semester. A lot of project team build seasons are in the winter and whatnot, for example. But I'm gonna say 60. There's definitely a lot of times where it can be a lot lower or a lot higher, depending on deadlines and year-long schedules.  

**What is the average number of rest hours you get per week in an average semester? Waking rest hours - so not time spent sleeping, but time you spend during the day not doing work.**  

I wanna say around 4-ish a day, but a lot of that's because in my co-op - I live in one of the co-ops - normally someone is in the den area, watching something or baking something. It definitely goes into the later hours of the day, though. I should also mention that a lot of the time when it's work, whether in a project team or just hanging out with people at a study group - generally, while it's work, it's more fun with the people I'm around. Like if I'm at a late night study group, we're gonna be joking around at the time. Or when we're working on the project team, we're just gonna talk about how the day went and whatnot. But I think 4-ish a day, including going later in the day, is more reasonable. 

But there are some days where I'll be on north campus from 8 AM to 8 PM or 9 PM. And then I just crash.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Busiest semester? Hmm. I'd say this past semester was very busy, including project team but also student org work. But probably the semester that required the most work was my second semester freshman year, because I was doing 17 credits of classes and 3 credits of research that were for pay. So that semester was probably closer to the seventies, but a lot of that was because many things got drawn out due to COVID - that was the first semester COVID. But I also have a bad tendency of stretching things out. Say, when I'm doing homework, I'll listen to music and it'll slow down my pace, but I'll still be getting it done. It's still time dedicated to work.  

**And for that busiest semester, what was the average number of waking rest hours you got per week?**  

That's hard, because that semester I was sleeping a lot, so my waking rest hours were less. I'd say around...I'm trying to make sure that my estimates add up to the right amount for a week. I'd say weekends, I didn't do a ton. Once COVID hit, it was different. I mean, it's weird. 'cause I was working a lot given, you know, hard classes and COVID, but I also had a lot of downtime because so many things got canceled. I wanna say around 20-ish, but that's because everything got canceled. Not going to conferences, not going to project team final meetings, et cetera. It was a lot of work because of Math 217, gen chem, research, philosophy...it all just took up a lot of time and it was really tough.  

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**

I'd say somewhere around 80, 90. There's definitely a couple weeks where I've had to take 10 hours each day or like go into the nights, finishing up some big projects. Especially when I did not put my time management into effect. I'd say around the 80s, 10 hours most days and then a little more; but that might be a little high when I say it out loud. That mainly happened when I really screwed up deadlines, but also just a lot of stuff popping up. That was the post-having finals hell period. I was pretty behind classes, and then I had to do all the final stuff and that was... 

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spent your time?**  

It's tricky. This has changed a lot recently, because I think when I came in, my first two years I truly overloaded myself. Not only was I taking a lot of classes, but I lived in, like, a house where I do a lot of chores. I guess the big thing which contributed to a lot of these work hours - it wasn't just school, but...a lot of people went home for the pandemic, and I, you know, New York was really bad. The city was really bad. So I didn't go back to New York City. It also doesn't help that both my parents moved to small apartments where I would've just been on the couch. So it wasn't just schoolwork, but it was a lot of finding apartments and dealing with landlords and moving, and you know, figuring out how to manage my life effectively. So I say that - sorry, can you repeat the question again? Okay. So I think that at that time, when I was jumping from place to place every four months for different reasons and just going on with the sophomore classes, I'd say I didn't have a lot of control. A big part of it was due to my financial aid package too. A couple years ago, I believe it was early 2020, is when my mom had to sell the house that I lived in my entire childhood. That would show up on financial aid, this coming year, the 2022-2023 school year. So I was put in a position where if I didn't finish my studies on time or early, then I would be slammed with an extra year or even two years of full-on Michigan tuition. So at that point in my life, I didn't really have a lot of control. Not only was I not at home, but I was kind of just scraping by. This past year was the first year in three years I've been in one place for a full year. So not a lot of control.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yes and no. I started off wanting to do a PhD, but then I realized that in industry there's so much more experience you can get in a lot of ways that - I mean, in academia and research you can do a ton of things, but you can do research in industry and get triple the salary. During COVID also, the 200 and 300 level electrical engineering classes were, well, you didn't really get the same experience. And every test was open notes. So at that time, I definitely felt that classes were a way to get through to my major and be done with the degree. But I guess now, these past couple months, even though it's been really hard some weeks - I decided to take a remote internship so I could be at home, and I think that's given me more autonomy and ability to recover.

Yeah. I think if I was in person, it would be bad news.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

I mean, definitely lower. But the fact that we're inside all day also contributed. UofM is so cold, you get seasonal depression for eight months a year. But again, the big thing with this year was that as busy as I was, living in a big house of 20 raised my energy levels a lot. When there's a social life within a house, even if you're had a really long day and you're burnt out, there's still moments where someone made brownies for the house or you can play video games with someone to de-stress. I think that's definitely raised my energy levels, and they've honestly helped me get out more. So I'd say lower freshman and sophomore year, a bit higher junior year, and hopefully higher senior year now that everything is in person and I can take the classes that I'm really interested in. 

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah. Well, the thing is that freshman and sophomore year, I had very, very good academic results for the entire time, except for a class that I pass-failed the first semester COVID hit. But a lot of that was that freshman year classes, given that I went to like a very competitive, super technical-focus high school, weren't too bad. Sophomore year classes that would've been bad weren't bad, because everything was an open notes test. For example, EECS 301 was completely open notes and had exam questions that had the answers on the slides - which the professor encouraged us to use during the test! So I guess this year, junior year, I definitely had a dip in academic performance. I think this year...it was tricky, because I definitely knew I was a bit burned out, but it was also the year where I was getting back to a normal routine and I felt pressured to do the things that I missed. Like doing extra work in the project team, doing extra work in student orgs, trying to broaden my horizons.  

And I guess I still have like, a very strong GPA, but I definitely got some Bs this semester when I normally am an A student. At the same time, I think I had a change of mentality where I used to be a perfectionist. I kind of realized that if I get a couple Bs but do well in my project teams and students orgs and feel better, then it's worth it. So definitely a dip in academic performance, partially from burnout, partially from a mentality change.  

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Yes. This is actually, that's a good question. I think this is something that stems from my childhood. I used to be a kid that had big dreams, and I definitely had a good amount of talent; but I didn't really think of the steps to get to the dream. A lot of stuff like introductory math came very easily, so it wasn't a gap there. I guess a lot due to family issues and unfair comparisons, middle school and high school became much more focused on the plan rather than the goal. You know, getting better at engineering, getting better at studies, maybe improving my social life - I will say my high school had a not-horrible social life, but Michigan has a great social life - for those goals I've been relatively successful. It's definitely tricky because COVID has made a lot of my goals unfeasible. But I accept that.  

A lot of short-term goals, like "get an MDP position", "get As", "do well in my classes", "get this stuff in the project team done" - overall those have been going well. But when I'm trying to do all these small goals, it makes it tough to think of and achieve the really big goals - doing my own capstone, doing something really amazing while I'm here. Not just an MDP project or a research project that I joined, but fully implementing and executing my own ideas and expressing myself in my work. I guess I haven't really accomplished that in the past few years, which I guess is my main issue: while I've done a lot of things, I'm lacking that feeling of fulfillment and completion that you would have in a normal work time frame without COVID, where a lot of things don't get disrupted. Where the research doesn't stop due to COVID.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

I was; I was a top 10 student. I wasn't like the valedictorian - they were incredibly impressive - but I was definitely a top student at the time, throughout elementary, middle school, high school, et cetera. Even though I don't have a 4.0 anymore, I still think I'm a strong student here at Michigan.

The value of being a top student rather than a top engineer is...of course I still need to do well, because good grades matter for stuff like the SUGS program and whatnot. But having a perfect GPA compared to having a good, meaningful career-related experience or something that I really enjoy doing - I'd rather have the latter rather than the former. It was switched for me growing up.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Yes. Especially because there's so many, I mean, I guess the thing is that while I wanted to do electrical engineering, I was relatively sure about that. There are so many people within electrical engineering - in their major scope, I should say, to broaden it a little - where they know exactly what to do. They wanna do, “Oh, I wanna do chemistry, ChemE, and compsci, I wanna mix them in this way”. Or “I love quantum physics”. And when you meet those people that not only are doing these amazing things now, but also mixed in their high school experiences and have been doing this for like six years at this point, it really makes you…and these people are doing, like, these amazing projects. I know I definitely, you know, don't wanna make comparisons to other people, but there are people at this university that, you know, you know, could become professors at a top university and are just super, super impressive.  

And I guess while I'm doing well academically, I definitely feel I'm falling behind compared to some of those peers because while I know I shouldn't compare myself to other people and I'm doing well overall, you know, I guess most Michigan engineers are doing much better than many people in our generation. I guess I've always had this, you know, mentality that, you know, I can't, if I put my mind to something, I can be the best, but given everything that's happened, you know, that doesn't always happen. And I guess I have to focus more on my growth at this point. And then if I wanna become the best, I can do that. But striving to be the best rather than being the best in what I wanna do is definitely a mentality I grew up with, but I hopefully can work out my, you know, my system. I just need to do the best in what I wanna do. And if that happens to being the best among my peers, then so be it.  

**Mm-hmm <affirmative> what is your relationship with failure?**  

Yeah. Okay. That's a, that's a good one. I guess it's tricky. Academically I haven't had a lot of failure, but with extracurriculars and in my personal life, I've definitely had a lot of failure since I've been at UofM, completing extracurricular projects and finding exactly what I wanna do. Extracurriculars have been tough. You know, I'm one of those people where if I don't like doing something a ton, then I am very unmotivated. I'm just not one of those people where I could stick out with something for an extended period of time. Because of that, something that normally would just be "I didn't like this, but now I'm done with it" becomes a failure. And I'm not gonna get into my personal life too much, but definitely a lot of failures stemming from that.  

I definitely felt like a failure for a while. Given I have a cousin four years older than me who is incredibly talented, economics master's and PhD from Stanford, Stanford bachelors - I definitely felt like a failure. While in some ways I was very good - I played a lot of competitive sport, and I was very good, but I was always a couple matches away from going professional, and that was also a failure. Definitely a lot of failure. I guess what I wanna say is that besides the personal life failures, they've definitely been failures, but no failures where it feels like my life is over. Failures are things that sting for a long time and where I know that I could've done much better, but in a way where I know I could either repair it or move on from it. It's not like a failure where I invested all of my savings in a stock that went down and I'm destitute, failures where it really hurts. I think about my failures for a long time, but I can get over them.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Oh, I hate it. Whenever someone says "I'm a genius" or "You're the best" or "Wow, I can't believe you're doing this", I wanna shoot myself. I guess I was born and raised to be humble, whatever I did. So if I do something that's really exceptional - which given all of the issues with COVID and lack of fulfillment with being done, I haven't had a lot - if anyone ever praises me that way, it feels like I did something wrong and I'm being too pompous in some way. Part of my personality is acting cocky; some of that is just how I roll. I just...I don't accept praise. Well, some things I haven't been able to finish due to personal management issues on my end. If it's not something that I feel like I did exceptionally, then even if to others it's an accomplishment, I don't feel like it's a success and I don't want people complimenting me on it. I just think of it as a stepping stone to improve for something greater in the future.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Tricky. Usually they're not very long. I'm proud of myself, but the issue is that again, I'm bad at not comparing myself to other people. So I always just compare myself to others. I'm definitely happy on the outside. But I always think I can do better. It's that situation where I say, "I could've done better", but if I wanted to do better, I would have to not get sleep. My mentality is, "I could've gotten that done. Why didn't I get that done then?" I don't think "If I wanted to get it done in this way, then I would've had a horrible, horrible state of life". I take steps to undermine my successes unless it's a great success.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I think they react well. I mean, in some orgs people are indifferent towards me, mostly the orgs where I don't invest myself often. But in the orgs that I'm involved with, I think people are very happy for me to be there. But I kind of take the fun out of a lot of things if it isn't just a party.

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

It's kind of when you're working - really, not even working. It's either when you're working hard and you don't take enough breaks, you don't take enough time to internalize and you just work, work, work, and then you say "I don't wanna". You get kind of bored of it though, that's definitely a symptom of burnout. But it just feels like you can't go on doing it, or you feel like you're missing something in life. Another way that burnout can happen is if you have a traumatic experience, even if it's not related to your work, and you just don't feel like you can go on. Whether you need to cope with that experience, or you don't think that you can integrate yourself in whatever you were doing before.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**

The definition's definitely been given a lot in classes; that's part of the Michigan curriculum. But I guess how I would define imposter syndrome is when you think - I mean, standard definitions - when you think in a group or some other setting that you don't deserve to be there, because you're not qualified enough. Whether you have the skills but you don't think you're good enough or you don't have the skills but you're in a setting where you're supposed to learn. You don't think you're good enough regardless of who you're with, or you always think you're the worst or you can't learn or you can't improve.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yes. I think I've experienced burnout a lot recently. I mean, COVID classes plus the financial situation, having to get through it, not really having the option to take a gap year - complete burnout. I was able to get through it, salvaging what could have been awful terms; but I definitely didn't feel as invested. I had that "why am I doing this?" mentality a lot of times, but I also knew that was often the only option I have. So burnt out to a max. I think I was also burnt out after the end of high school; everyone had all the extracurriculars, and you know, you have class from 8 AM to 3 PM and then you have clubs, and then you get six hours of sleep at night if you're lucky. 

The summer after high school, I wanted to do things. I was just in my room, on my Nintendo, playing video games instead of being productive. I just could not. So definitely burnout at the end of high school. I wasn't burned out freshman year, piled up work but wasn't burnt out. Just busy. COVID hit, complete burnout, because I was asking myself "Why am I continuing on with all this?" Even if you can transfer, say, math classes more easily online than, say, language classes.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yes, definitely. When I came into high school, I could have done the math team, I could have done research - I was three years ahead in math. I told myself, "Well, the best people across the city know I am good enough". I ended up in the top 10 and came to Michigan. So I did well in high school, and I thought if I was one of the best among these very great students, then maybe when I go to Michigan, I'll be great. Nope! There's so many incredible people at Michigan too. So while I think I claimed a bit of a stake, I don't think that - like, I have some imposter syndrome comparing myself to what I could be, just seeing and meeting some of the most impressive people at this university. But that balances out with the fact that I do know that I am doing well here overall, despite it being incredibly shitty at times. And I do deserve to be here. So yes and no.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**

Now, especially, it's everywhere. Tons of my friends are taking gap years or have to take all-nighters, and they're half-joking around like, "Hey everyone, I had to take four all-nighters this week". And it's impossible for people not to be burnt out when that happens. It's tricky because you either take a break during COVID because you are burnt out, or you stick to it because you have to finish - and obviously that burns you out. So many people are burned out at this stage, and I guess it's tricky because a lot of people - I don't know too many people that are just complete shut-ins. I hang out with a lot of these people, and it seems like everyone's happy, has friends, et cetera. And a lot of people are very excited to tell you how their day was and how their test was bad because it was poorly designed. But most people don't really talk about burnout, because it's a "sign of weakness". And as much as it's obvious people are burned out, people don't try and show it.  

Just to add on, there's a lot of times where I act super happy-go-lucky, crack a lot of bad jokes - not offensive, just bad, like dad jokes. And again, with personal issues that have grown over the years, it's how to put up that facade. But a lot of people do that in some way to seem happier and more successful than they are right now.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

Tricky. I'm involved in a lot of student orgs, and as someone in a leadership position of an honor society, I do talk to a lot of people with really high GPAs. It's tough to say you have imposter syndrome when you're around those people because you might think you don't have imposter syndrome if you're one of them. But everyone's struggling and even the best struggle with imposter syndrome. Everyone compares themselves, everyone shows off different tidbits of knowledge. But when you're around the best and you know that you're the best, you can act confident in some way.  

So it definitely depends on the group. And the thing about me is that not all the groups of friends I'm with are super elite. Many are not elite at all; it's kind of half and half. It's not like I'm with all the really smart, preppy, successful kids or I'm with all of the chill, maybe not great grade-wise, but spiritually or mentally healthy kids. It's a mix. So it's interesting to see how everyone reacts to the situation.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah - um, after this question, I do have to plug in my laptop - but okay. It's tricky. The big thing with COVID-19 is that with burnout and imposter syndrome, if you're talking with other people and you see how they're doing, it's easier to identify your own burnout. Because you can see what the situation is for everyone. But when you're locked in a room and it's only yourself, of course you can see that you're burned out, but there's no one to tell you that you're burned out. So it's the same thing. You know, when you get older, a big reason why time flies is the lack of stimulus, because everything becomes the same. It feels like everything goes faster. So when you're on your own, things feel like they go faster.  

But when things go faster, you think you're making progress, but then you're just sitting in your room and not succeeding. If you're doing that - I mean, that's the thing with COVID; the people that succeeded are the people that changed their routines and realized that it's not going to be the same. But assuming you didn't do that and you stayed in routine, it's easy to think that you're doing fine and you're not burned out, when you actually are.  

**Okay, almost done. Just a few more questions. I'll let you plug in your laptop.**

This laptop is weird - it has two batteries. 

**I haven't heard a laptop with two batteries being a thing.**  

Yeah, it's because it's a surface book. So there's a battery for the screen side and a battery for like, the keyboard side. If they're not together, there are times where the keyboard battery - like the screen battery says it's fine, but then the keyboard battery will go to zero. And it depends what you're doing on the computer. You'll have 30% battery, then it just dies. 

Okay, we're good. Continue.  

**Considering everything we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**

Honestly, right now? Yes. I think in the past couple months, I've made some very wise decisions that have prepared me for senior year in a good way. I've been not in New York for three years at this point. And now I just took a remote internship where I can be at home, hang out with friends and family. I don't have to commute, I can work on a more safe and healthy way of life. I dropped all the project teams that I was doing but not enjoying due to COVID or, you know, the content. And I've been cutting away what I either don't wanna do or what I realize I can't do.  

It's not like everything's normal at this point, like you can make all the commitments and push through what you just can't do. I'm actually very excited right now for my senior year. And I think it also helps that this past semester, I only took 13 credits. Besides a discrete math class that I wasn't the greatest fan of, I took classes that I enjoyed. And I'm really excited for next year with all the really cool upper levels. And I took a summer, instead of working and commuting all the time, to just rest and relax and hang with friends and get my life together a little. So I'm excited. But I think during the bulk of the pandemic, as much as - you know, the major is interesting, and I like math - it's not what it should have been. 

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Very. It was a big issue at my high school. It was a test-in school, very talented students wanting to get to the best university, lots of hard workers, comparing yourself to everyone else, et cetera. So very prevalent.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Okay, that's a good one. The advice that I would give to myself is, you should try to be the best you can be, but don't try to be the best. It'll just happen that way. Don't reach for the stars in an unhealthy way. You should pursue your dreams and you should push yourself to be the best you can be; but if you're doing it in a way that's unhealthy, not conducive to good health, good sleep, good relationships - which is really what college is about - that's okay. Just do what you can and do what you think can preserve your mental health.

**Is there anything else you'd like to say?**  

I wanna say I think this is a very good idea for a survey. I guess for anyone who reads this - if this makes it in the final cut - um, just take a couple minutes, maybe a day, walk in the woods, if there's a park or something near you, and just think about all the good things that you've done recently and be happy for your future. As much as everything right now can seem like your entire life and your entire future, that's just not the case. You have so much time to change. If you want, improve and focus on your passions later, that's good. Make it through healthy and happy now. That's all.  

**All right, that's the end of the interview. Thank you for participating.**
