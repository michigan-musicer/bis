**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

You mean just high school?  

**Yeah, whatever you feel is relevant from before UofM.**  

Yeah. So I went to a specialized high school in New York City, and I had to test to get into that. That was from seventh to 12th grade, and yeah, that was a little more rigorous than a normal high school.  

**Approximately how many people did you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

For close peers, I'd say I had maybe three or four friends who were usually in a similar class, as in we took a similar class at some point - or just in general, peers in the CS field. So I would say there's only a handful of them. I had a lot more friends who didn't take CS, so it was like, not academic peers, but there were just social friends, just people I hang out with. But they weren't in CS.  

**How many of those social peers do you have approximately?**  

Maybe five or so close friends? So 10 total, including CS and not CS.  

**How many years were you in your major, for both undergraduate and graduate?**  

Three years undergraduate, one year graduate.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major, for both undergrad and continuing into grad?**  

So undergrad, I came in wanting to do mechanical engineering, because I liked taking physics and math courses in high school. I felt like it was kinda the next step to do some kind of engineering, and then I read that mechanical engineering was the more generalist engineering. Like, you can kind of go into what you want with mechanical engineering. But then I decided that I didn't really like the job prospects for mechanical engineering. A lot of them are not - so I'm from New York city, so being able to find jobs in a bigger city was kind of important to me just 'cause that's how I grew up and I kind of like that atmosphere. So I wanted to do something in a city.  

And so I felt with any kind of science or STEM background, maybe CS or finance are usually the two main things in cities, and I didn't really like finance that much. That was more of a business kind of thing. So I just felt like CS was naturally the next choice for my future. It just felt right. And also when I took AP CS in high school, I really liked the material - that was fun. I just didn't know if I wanted to do that full-time. And then I guess after looking at job prospects, where I could go with the majors, I felt like my interest and the job prospects lined up. So yeah.  

And then for grad school, I realized I wanted to specialize a little bit more machine learning and computer vision stuff. I took some classes in undergrad and I did a bit of research in it, so I thought this stuff was kind of interesting. Mainly, I feel like I kind of lost a lot of college because of COVID, so if the school was offering me - because I graduated early 'cause I came in with a lot of AP credits - because I feel like naturally, if I came in with AP credits and I graduate early and the school offered me one year to do a master's program, I feel like I get to make up for lost time by doing that, make up for the year of COVID, and then I also get a master's degree of it - which, er, I kind of realized I wanted do machine learning, AI, that field later into my undergrad career, like my last year. I guess that also let me go in a little deeper than my undergrad led me, just because I did graduate earlier and I didn't have a lot of time to flush that out.   

I ended up doing the master's degree in computer engineering just because I think the curriculum offered a lot more freedom than the computer science program. Computer science had a lot of required courses, and it just had a lot less freedom in the classes I get to choose than computer engineering. At the end of the day, I still get the same value out of it, at least what I think is the same value out of it. That was a little long-winded but yeah, that's my answer.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

I guess right before COVID hit, I was in computer security, EECS 388. They had this one project, which I think I heard they specifically created just for that year. For some reason, it was super hard; I heard they even discontinued it the semester after I took it, so I guess it was extra hard, so they didn't even wanna, like, continue it? I remember I just didn't feel like doing it for some reason. 388 had multi-part projects, so it was little mini-projects. I did most of them except for the final part, which I heard was hard, over spring break; and I came back from spring break and I was thinking that it was completely fine, that it's a pretty chill project, just because everything else in the course had been very chill - as long as I did the work, paid attention to the lecture, I could have done the work. 

But then this one was just like not related to anything we did in lecture. I think the GSI turned it into his pet project, and he kind of did it just 'cause he liked the material and...I don't know. It was a disaster, and I feel like everyone in the class had no idea what was going on. So I remember I had to pull - it was due in half a week or something like a week after spring break ended -  so I remember I was like pulling back to back all-nighters just trying to get the project done, just because it was so so difficult. 

I don't think I've ever had any other project like that. That's why it's so memorable, because even though I've had other difficult projects before, there's nothing that was difficult to the point where there were no resources from the class, only one GSI had a competent answer at any given time - like it was only the GSI who really designed the project who really knew what was going on. The professors weren't in the loop on the project either, they were kind of just doing their own thing. It was one of the worst-managed projects I've done, and it led to a bunch of all-nighters just to try to figure it out. Even my friends didn't know what was going on, so it was a group of us in the library, overnight, just trying to grind it out.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

I guess on average I took 16 to 18 credits per semester. In grad school, that was nine credits maximum.  

So usually that's four classes. Four classes is maybe three hours of lecture a week plus a discussion, right? So maybe 15, 16 hours just of classes and discussions alone in a given week. And then I wanna estimate...I usually do a few hours of homework every night, so maybe three hours a day of homework or studying or catching up, approximately. So I'd say was that 16, plus three times five...On the weekdays that's 31 hours? Plus I would always have work on the weekend. I think I always tried to have work done before the weekend, but it never happened, never ended up being like that. So maybe 40 hours I'd say on average. I'm giving extra hours just because some weeks are a little lighter, but usually there'd be a test I have to study for or something. So I'm gonna give those extra hours to that.  

**Does this approximation differ between graduate and undergraduate?**  

Yeah, definitely. I do feel like my undergraduate was more work, just because I had the mindset that I wanted to try to finish in three years. I remember I came in with a lot of AP credits, and I thought financially and - it was mainly financially. I wanted to try to get it done in three years because I don't wanna waste another two semesters on tuition when I didn't have to. I remember I did have many semesters in a row where I basically did the maximum number of credits. They recommend only taking three EECS classes per semester; I filled it out with maybe four EECS classes per semester, and that was pretty rough. I also like a lot of odd credits, 'cause usually EECS classes are four credits worth, er, most classes are four credits worth. You could take 18 credits maximum, so 16 credits of classes plus two credits of research or two credits of some other, smaller things just to hit the 18 credits so I could graduate early. So it was a lot, definitely a lot more work in undergrad, plus when you first started undergrad, you have to manage meeting new people, making new friends. The first few years are a little more rough. Honestly, I feel like COVID kind of helped me a lot because it helped me manage my time easier, because I was so overloaded.  

Just like having more time, cutting commute time out of my schedule helped a lot, but yeah, it was still a lot more. For grad school, I was a little more settled in and I wasn't really meeting that many new people, so I didn't really have the social aspect to worry about. So I feel like I had more time that way. Grad school's also nine credit maximum versus 18, so even though classes may be a little harder, it's not so much that I still have the same amount of work with literally half the number of credits. So that was a little lighter. I think grad school was overall much more relaxed for me. Also that was my last semester, so I didn't wanna overload myself too much on grad school either. I took enough to learn a lot, but not overachieve like I did in undergrad.   

**What is the average number of waking hours you got per week in an average semester? When I say waking rest, I mean time you're not sleeping, but time during the day that you're taking for yourself.**   

 I think undergrad - so I'm the type of person where I try to get six to eight hours of sleep a day. So that means if I sleep late, the next day I might wake up a little later just because it's hard for me to pay attention in classes and or pay attention to my work if I'm low on sleep. So in undergrad, the only times I really stayed up less than seven-ish hours was when I had a flight coming up. So I'd say on average maybe seven hours a night for resting. And then when I had a project coming up where I needed to grind it out or a deadline coming up, I would sleep less.  

I feel like that works for me because a lot of times, I lose my train of thought or I run out of focus if I take a break. So if I'm working on a hard project, for example, and then I end up taking an eight hour rest, I kind of don't have the same energy to go through. It's a lot easier for me to keep going when I'm working versus picking up from after, like, a day of rest or picking up after a day of class. So usually I just go straight if I'm working really hard at something. Yeah. So I'd say average...maybe if I count that, a little less than seven or six hours of rest time on undergrad. I didn't really pull all-nighters in grad school. I managed my work well because there were less classes for me and less things to manage. So grad school I tended to sleep seven to eight hours. Maybe some nights six, if I hung out with friends late and I had to wake up early the next day. But yeah, that's usually around six to eight hours of rest, not counting all-nighters, which was maybe once a month in undergrad if I had a lot of projects.  

**Okay. How about time that you rest during the day?**  

Okay, yeah. So during the day, I think when classes were in person, I usually rested after class. I think I mostly had classes in the morning during my first two years of college. So I wake up, eat breakfast, and go to class. After class around lunchtime, I have some rest; usually I like resting in the afternoon. I think I do most of my work at night, and that's also if I wanted to do group study with friends or working on homework together, a night time works better for everyone. So usually I get maybe one or two hours in between lunch and when people start working, on most days.  

Usually I just kind of pick that as rest time because like I said before, it's hard for me to pick up and put down work quickly. So if I do wanna do work, I'd rather just pick it up and kind of just go at it. So I usually had a rest time before I sat down and started grinding it out. Usually after dinner time, I would just work until I go to sleep. So maybe I'd say on average, in-person, two hours. And it became a lot more when I was remote, just because a lot of things stopped. I didn't have any clubs to go to 'cause we were remote 'cause of COVID; I didn't have to go in-person to classes, so there was no commute time. So I think the number of rest hours increased a lot. Maybe three or four hours a day, I'd just take a chill, you know, and didn't have to really work that hard.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Busiest semester was definitely when I mentioned before, when I had that one project.   

I took three upper level classes at a time plus...I forget whatever other classes I had going on too. But yeah, that one was pretty rough. I think that semester I worked on average - not even counting class time, which I think was an average of three to six hours a day, depending on how many lectures I had, or three to five-ish - I usually worked from whenever I finished dinner, like six, seven o'clock or seven, eight o'clock just until I slept. I usually finish around midnight every night; I think it was very rare that I went past 1:00 AM or 2:00 AM. So I'd say maybe 8:00 PM to midnight. That's four or five hours of work every single day? And then I also worked on the weekends too, I remember, because I had so much work. I definitely didn't work the same amount of time on the weekends, but weekends were definitely also busy. So maybe I spent like...four or five hours a day for the seven days, so 35 hours just on homework alone. And then you know, going to class and everything and all that stuff also took a lot of time.  

**And for that semester, what was the average number of rest hours during the day that you got per week?**

Uh, maybe average of one per day? Just in between finishing class and before I eat dinner. Yeah, maybe. I don't remember exactly my work habits, 'cause that was two or three years ago, but I think I wanna estimate, like, I, I don't think I ever did homework throughout the day. Unless it was something super busy or I was waiting for a long time during the day. But I think usually it was just one hour. I guess I'd relax a bit on the bus ride back to my dorm, and when I get back to my dorm, I'd just lie down if I'm tired, recharge for a bit before going back out.  

So one to two hours per day just doing nothing, being on my phone and stuff. Usually the rest of it, like the cracks in between my classes I usually spent going to office hours, reading up on something. Even though I wasn't actively coding or actively working on practice problems - 'cause it's hard for me to pick that up and put that down easily - my free time in between classes was mostly spent reading material or catching up on old lectures, just refreshing myself so I don't have as much work to do when I do sit down and grind out practice problems or coding assignments and stuff.  

**I'm guessing you already answered this question, but what is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

Yeah, so I did mention before that one project. In addition to that one project, I also had a 370 project that week too. And also, I took EECS 490, so I had to have time for that too. So I think that one specific week...actually, no. There was another week during when I took 482, that was also pretty rough. I don't know which one was more hours, but I think the week where I took 482 and there was a difficult project and my group was kind of stuck - I would wake up at 10:00 AM, get on the office hours queue, and as soon as we got on the queue, which was maybe 11:30, we'd just work on it straight until, for some days, 1:00 AM. Just getting on the office hours queue, asking them questions, figuring that out...  

I did take breaks in the middle for, you know, eating lunch, eating dinner; but most of the time there wasn't any longer than an hour break, I think. So those weeks, that was maybe 10 hours of work straight for five days or something like that, just to get the assignments done. I think those were pretty rough, 50 hours maybe or something. I mean, it would usually just be the week before the assignment's due, and then we'd want to try to get it done, get 100% on the points. So if we were missing one or two test cases or bugs that weren't immediately apparent, we spent a lot of time just trying to figure those out.   

**How much control did you feel you had over how you spent your time?**  

I think it varied semester to semester. I think that usually I had a good control of my time. The only times when it got a little too much for me and I had to sacrifice either sleep or sacrifice some of my resting time to work on it was mainly just those two semesters I talked about - the one where took a lot of classes and the projects weren't very, um, well-planned or very difficult; and then another one where I took 482, which was a notoriously high workload class, and so I had to manage that with my three other classes I was taking, because 482 alone was already taking basically 80% of the time - so I did have to work with other classes too. I think those semesters were especially rough, and I feel like I didn't have a lot of control of how I spent my time there. I'd just kinda work, work, work. My other semesters I did were a little lighter. I definitely had more control of my time then. just because, like, it's lighter. I got to choose when I went to stop work, when I went to start work, because there wasn't always a deadline, so I didn't always have to be working on something.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

I think it's been kind of back and forth. When I did start, I was kind of ambitious. I wanted to do some research, 'cause I thought the stuff was kind of cool. Um, I did want to try new things, learn kind of a little bit of everything. And then I think I did get a little burnt out in the middle, because like I said, I was trying to graduate early, so I did overload on classes. I definitely didn't get a lot of what I wanted to out of some of these classes. Some of them I just uh, didn't really learn or take the time to learn it, just because I was so busy dealing with the deadlines I just had to get done.  

I think it's a little harder to learn and appreciate what you're learning or just absorb it all if you're so focused on getting the deadlines out and moving on to the next assignment. So I think in that regard I did like, lose that enthusiasm of learning. I remember for 388, the cybersecurity class, like I said before, the homework and the lectures don't really line up at all. So at a certain point, I just didn't even watch the lectures just because they were not relevant to the homework whatsoever. The homework was all done by GSIs, professors did the lectures, and other than a very high level overview, there was nothing related to lecture that was in the assignments.  

So I just stopped learning about cybersecurity and just learned how to do the homework, because that's all that was needed from me and like, I had other priorities to worry about. I have other classes to care about too. So that kind of enthusiasm I did kind of lose, just because I needed to get my assignments done. Also, I felt like it was very hard for me to focus on research too. At the time I was debating if I wanted to pursue a grad program, like a master's or PhD. So I did research because I wanted to see what it was like and give it a shot; but I didn't feel like I got as much out of it just because I was so swamped with trying to graduate early that again, research just kind of became "As long as I fulfill what is needed of me this week, I am okay".  

Like I never really took the time to go beyond, just because I didn't really have the free time to go past what was required of me. So I definitely think if I did space out my time more, I would've gotten more out of some things like that. If I didn't take all these classes so close together, like so many classes at once, I would've had more time to actually learn and understand material, just because I wouldn't be so...so worried about the next class, next deadline. And for research specifically, I think if I had more time to dedicate to that, I think I definitely would've gotten more out of it.  

But at the end of the day, I think I kind of lost enthusiasm for research, so I stopped doing it for grad school. That's when I decided I was kind of burned out from academics. I didn't really wanna go through a PhD or beyond a master's anymore. I felt like master's was good enough, and I decided I could just go into industry with the masters and that was okay. I didn't really have a passion for the PhD, and I was okay with not pursuing my studies any further. So I guess there is that level of burnout, but I don't know if I necessarily call it just burnout, because it's also me accepting one of my career paths, that this isn't going to get me anything more than what I already have. Like I already have the master's that I wanted, I already kind of took the classes I wanted, and I didn't think the PhD was necessary. But part of it was also just burnout and that I didn't wanna do academics. I already took so many classes and I already struggled for a bit. I didn't think I needed to do anything else.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, yeah, I think I did have a lot more energy at the start, just 'cause as a freshman, it's like, "I wanna get as much outta college, I wanna do everything. I wanna meet more people and go to all these events, join all these clubs"; and I think...mainly because of COVID and there was a big gap in making friends - I got close with the friends I already have versus making more friends. So the energy level of meeting new people was kind of at a low, because especially when we went back in person, it was just like, it's been so long since I went to all these social events, I'm about to graduate already, and I kind of skipped out on basically two years of meeting new people. So I think in terms of energy level - that was pretty low. I didn't really feel like joining any more clubs, 'cause during COVID I kind of dropped all my clubs. They weren't really meeting or they were just not doing anything, so when I came back in my final year in person, I didn't feel as strong of a connection to these same clubs, so I didn't end up picking that up either. So there was definitely a big dip in social energy. I think mainly just because of COVID, I think it was just a very big transition, just losing all these social circles and connections...it's just very hard. If they weren't really maintained when I was remote, then coming back in person, there's really nothing left to come back to.

I think for work energy, that's mostly been consistent. I think I'll burn out here and there, but usually, when I finish the semester, it gets a little refreshed. I get that like winter break or summer break, and there's never really a dip into, like, I don't wanna learn anymore. I think I try to get the most out of every semester in terms of learning. Like I mentioned before, some semesters I did not get as much as I wanted to just because I was so busy and I didn't have time to process everything. But I think the next semester after, I always went for a fresh start. I never took less classes one semester just because the last semester was rough. So I think in terms of that kind of energy, I stayed the same, but social energy definitely went lower.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

No, I think my academics mostly stayed constant. There was a small dip in the two hardest semesters I took, a small dip, not very large. It was just very hard to maintain good grades when you take so many of these classes. For myself, I just had to sacrifice at least one of them. I felt like I couldn't handle getting good grades in every single class I took, so for example, the class where I took three upper levels, I just chose one upper level, and I said, "Alright, I just don't think I can focus on you that much anymore". As long as I'm getting a passing grade, I'll have to sacrifice it.  

That was also a semester that there was a pass / fail for COVID, which I got really lucky in because it was okay to just pass that class, because it wouldn't really affect my GPA that much. So I did have to sacrifice some classes here and there, but I think overall, I did try my best to maintain my GPA - it never really dipped at any point. But if it hadn't been for pass / fail policies, there definitely would've been dips. But I think overall, they're a few outliers, not a trend where it just trended downwards.  

**When you set goals to yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Trying to think...so yeah. Usually when I set goals for myself academically, I don't expect myself to be 100% following those. So for example, if I say I wanna get this done ideally by next week, it's not a hard deadline, just an estimation. I'd say more often than not, I don't end up meeting those goals, but I think it's good for me to set goals just because I wanna be able to pace myself or set a good, er, balance between how fast I'm going versus how much time I have left on the project. That's the hardest goal I have, and I usually beat that.  

Sometimes I take the late days, but I don't think I've ever, like - I always handed my stuff in on time. The goals I set for myself are mainly just benchmarks, just so I can feel like I'm keeping up a good pace. For example, if a project's due in a month, maybe if it's a four part project, I want to get every single part done within a week. But if I don't meet those goals, it's not the end of the world for me. I just gotta work a little harder later on, and usually that just happens. The beginning's usually a little slow, and then the week before the project deadline, I end up taking a little bit more time just to work a little harder on it.

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

I mentioned before it was grade seven to 12, and I did have to test in. So I think the expectation was - so a lot of schools in New York City are similar, where you tested in and these schools are a lot tougher than a public school, so you'd be expected to say, do college level classes earlier and stuff like that. So I think - sorry, can you repeat the question? I just lost my train of thought.  

Okay. I think where I was going with that: I think a lot of people did expect, because they tested into these specialized schools, the bar was a lot higher. I think when I started off, I didn't realize that. I know a lot of other people did realize that, and they had parents that pushed them because their parents kind of understood it. My parents didn't really understand the college application process, they didn't really know about it that much. So I think a lot of my other peers, they did a lot more extracurriculars than I did starting off. A lot of them did do college-level work in ninth or 10th grade. A lot of them did research programs, where it's a high school research thing where basically they just work with other colleges as a normal research assistant, but in high school; and I didn't really do that.  

And I feel like I should've. I didn't realize that until too late - like when I started applying for colleges, I realized that a lot of my peers kind of understood that way before me. I did take a lot more APs in my final few years of high school, and I did try to boost up my application, but I don't think I was the best student because I think I was pretty average in my school. Because I went to one of these kind of schools, the bar was just so high that the majority of those people ended up going to Ivy league schools, and I just was very average. I didn't go to any of those Ivy league schools, I went to, you know, a top tier public school, but obviously at the end of the day, the bar for that entry is a little lower than the bar for Harvard, where a lot of my friends did go to: Harvard, Yale, Princeton.  

**Did you ever feel pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**

Superhuman? As in, above average?  

**Have you ever felt like you had to do more than what is humanly possible?**  

Um, no, I don't think so. I think because my high school was a little more rigorous, the jump from high school to college wasn't too bad for me. I did pretty well starting off. I know there are some people who did have a bit of a rough transition, so for them, they thought that college workload was a little high. But I think personally for me, I was always used to having high workloads, and I didn't think anything the school expected of me was beyond my capabilities. I think that by forcing myself to be a little more like, er, taking more credits per semester, trying to graduate early - it's something I brought upon myself. But it definitely wasn't an expectation that someone take that many classes or take that many credits every semester.  

So I don't think that was the problem? I do think, though, that some classes do give a lot more work than others. So I feel like some professors don't really understand - or I don't wanna say understand, but some professors aren't very flexible in terms of understanding that their students have other classes to take. I know a big complaint's always that this professor doesn't realize I have other classes to do too. Like, this is not my only class. So I feel like in that regard, I have heard that a lot, where some people don't think a class is very fair in terms of how much work they're given proportional to any other class. But at the end of the day, I never felt it was beyond my capabilities.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

I definitely don't have that great of a relationship with failure. I feel like if I end up failing something, it does get me down for a bit longer than I'd say most people. Like I'm the type of person who lingers on my thoughts, so if I end up not doing too well on something or failing a class, I'll probably thinking what I did wrong. Like "Why didn't I get this?" For example, when I apply to internships or jobs and I fail an interview or I don't get a callback, I definitely do linger on it. Especially if I get to the final round of interview and I mess up at the end, that kind of failure stings a lot for me. I just feel like I do linger on it for a bit longer than I would like to.

**Yeah. How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Academic praise? I don't know. I feel like praise in general - like if I help my friend out for a homework or something, I get some praise for that, but I don't really cling onto that too much. Like if I help someone out on a homework or a project, they're like, "Well, thanks for that, you're a big help" and stuff like that. It's just kind of another compliment, you know? I never really take it anywhere, I just kinda thank them and go forward, or just listen to it and just move on.

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

I usually feel satisfied with myself, especially the harder I tried to do this - it feels like the hard work or the work I put in has paid off. I'm not the type of person who lingers too much on...I think for a lot of people too, it's easier to linger on the negatives than the positives. So for me, when I do think about my successes, I never really linger on it. I just accept that I did it well or I finished the project and just move on.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I think depending on the person, - like my closer circle of friends, if any of us really succeed or something, like if one gets a job or something, I think we're all pretty supportive of each other. Especially if, let's say someone had a dream job and their friend got it; I don't think they'd be too upset about it. At the end of the day, I don't think it's healthy. I don't think my friends really drag each other down for getting something that they wish they had. Yeah, I think it's mostly supportive. I don't think there's anyone who, if someone succeeded, they'd be super upset by that. Or like, a little bit insulted that their friends succeeded, but they didn't, you know.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah, I have had the term burnout.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

I think for me burnout is...I dunno. It's kind of hard to describe it, but I think in simplest terms, you're maybe pushing yourself too hard or something like that, and you hit a wall; that's what I consider burnout. Let's say you are very ambitious, maybe, and you wanna join all these clubs, take all these classes, and then all of a sudden it's very overwhelming for you, and then you've hit a wall and then you don't think you can handle it all. I feel like that's what I consider burnout.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yeah, I have.  

**How do you define that in your words?**  

I feel like imposter syndrome is when you compare yourself to your peers, and so you see their successes or what they do or what you think they do, and then you just feel like you're not capable of being that or you don't belong because you don't do what they do. So you feel like an imposter, basically.

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah. I think I definitely did burnout. There definitely have been times where the start of my semester is much more ambitious than the end of my semester. Maybe my grades or projects are a little higher from the beginning of the semester or my drive is a little higher at the beginning of the semester, and then by the end of the semester, I do kind of slow down, like not end up being able to do the clubs I want or put as much time into learning as I want. Like I mentioned before, sometimes I just had to sacrifice classes - just as long as I pass the class, it's okay. I do burn out in that regard.

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah. I don't think I experienced it too much compared to burning out, just because I think a lot of my friends are pretty supportive, which I'm glad for. I think sometimes I can say that, um - for example, recently full-time jobs have been a very big thing. And if I want to like, work for a company and then my friends get into that company, I do feel like...it's a little bit where I wish that I had gotten the same offer, yeah. But I think generally, I don't have as much of imposter syndrome, just because I do try to tell myself that's, um, I do try to keep a healthy mindset.  

I think I was very stressed, in my high school too, about imposter syndrome. So I have had experience with this; I've had talks about it in the past with my guidance counselors and teachers. I think my high school made a big thing about it, so I think I was able to handle that when I went to college, 'cause like I had that mindset in high school.

**How prevalent do you believe burnout was among your peers?**  

I think one of my closer friends at UofM definitely had a lot of burnout. He was very ambitious, wanted to take all the harder classes, and I think like, he ended up not - like at the end of the four years, he ended up not taking as many classes as he wanted to. He kind of turned from "I want to take all the harder classes and I want to learn a lot" to kind of just, "I just want to graduate at this point". Like for him, it wasn't that big of a deal if he didn't graduate. So I think he specifically did burn out a bunch. I do also know people who slowed down their pace of what they wanted to do or much they wanted to accomplish in undergrad.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome was among your peers?**  

So I don't think any of my friends really talked about imposter syndrome too much, so I'm actually not 100% certain. I don't think it was something we necessarily talked about amongst each other, but I would have to imagine there were definitely some people who did feel it. Maybe not people I was close to, but they would, not in a super apparent way - but I think it's not uncommon that most people would once a while feel like they're not accomplished enough or that they should be doing more.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Honestly, I feel like I was pretty burnt out before COVID even happened in my undergrad. Honestly I think the COVID pandemic kind of helped with burnout, because it gave me more time to take things a little slower. Like I didn't have to commute to class, and I didn't have a lot of the same needs I did in person, so it definitely helped manage the burnout. As far as imposter syndrome, I feel like nothing really changed over the pandemic. I was still aware of it, and it wasn't like that really went away. But I think with my burnout, it definitely helped a lot during the pandemic.

**Okay.**  

**Close to wrapping up: considering everything that we've talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yeah, I think I did overall enjoy my time at Michigan. I think I did learn a lot, I'm excited to apply what I learned, hopefully, to my job and my future, and I think it's nice to...I think most of the time I was never alone, which I think was a big help. Every single class I feel like I was struggling with, I always had good friends in the class or a support network that would also kinda help me and go to the class with me, basically.  

So I never felt like I was by myself. So I think in that regard, I can look fondly back on. There were a lot of times where I felt like it was a kind of a bonding experience for some classes, where I kind of struggled with friends together to get closer while working on assignments.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I was pretty conscious of it. I mentioned before, my high school did talk about it because it was a rigorous high school. So I was made aware of it, and I did talk about it. So that's why I think personally it was a bit of an easier transition going into college, because I was already aware of it from high school, so I got to have a healthy relationship like, dealing with it, being aware of it...yeah.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I think I honestly was a little too ambitious when I just started out. I did take a lot more on my plate than I should have, so I think I did burn out a lot faster than I thought. So I think to my past self, I would say maybe take some time, or maybe find a healthier way to manage my time or a better schedule for myself so I didn't have to take so much on my plate at once. That probably would've helped a lot.

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Um, no, not especially. I just feel like...yeah, not especially.  

**Okay. In that case, thank you for your time and I will stop the recording.**
