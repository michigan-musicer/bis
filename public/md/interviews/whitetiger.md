**Aright. As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Okay. So prior to UofM, I did my engineering and computer science, and I also did mathematics as a second major at BITS Pilani back in India. It's one of the premier private schools, if not the best. I mean, that's debatable, but yeah - it's one of the premier private schools in India.  

I did fairly well over there. So I did my bachelor's in computer science and mathematics, as I said. I got into machine learning pretty early, probably in my first or second semester of studies. We had this five year program, so my first four years were in university and my last year was entirely a research experience. I was in Europe for a year at a computer vision lab, and that's where I pursued my bachelor thesis. Post-that, I had a six month gap because of COVID, but I was still working with my previous lab. And then I joined UofM.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

At UofM, probably about...let's say 100-200 people? Like everybody in EECS, pretty much? Not EECS in general, but anyone somehow related to machine learning, in EECS or otherwise, but somehow related to machine learning, I guess.

So that would be only master's students specifically, not PhD students, I guess. Also seniors and juniors who are starting to get into it. Yeah.   

**You said UofM specifically earlier. Does that imply that there was a difference in the number of peers that you had at Bilani, or...Pilani? Sorry.** 

Yeah, in BITS Pilani, I guess I would consider whoever was in computer science to be my peer, so like my classmates. And at UofM, I just mentioned, right? Um, so outside of UofM, it would be just the people who I know from undergrad, essentially. Those people I would consider as peers as well.

**How many years have you been in your major, for both grad and undergrad?**  

So undergrad, five years. And this is my second year of master's studies. So about seven I'd say.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major, for both undergrad and continuing into grad?**  

Yeah. So for undergrad, it's kind of a funny story. So I thought I was interested in mechanical engineering. So just before choosing my major, I met a couple of the head of departments at both computer science and mechanical engineering at BITS Pilani.  

I talked to them and they gave me some ideas about how you should choose your major, like what really interests you. And then I realized that - I mean, I like coding in general. We had a computer science class in 11th and 12th grade as well. So yeah, thought about it for a while, and then I decided to go with computer science. And then math happened because I was studying computer science, but I thought at our university, we weren't doing enough math to supplement what I was studying. And machine learning, for instance - because before I chose math as my major, I was already enrolled in the machine learning course and the MOOC course on Coursera by Andrew [editor's note: this refers to a Massive Open Online Course taught by a professor named Andrew Ng]. So yeah, I realized that there was a lot of math, which I didn't think my computer science program would introduce me to. So I decided to take up math as well.  

And so for my master's programs, I applied to four or five universities in America. So the rationale behind choosing EECS was because I liked a couple of research groups here, which were associated with machine learning. So I kind of switched my subfields in a way over the period of my master's, but initially I thought I'd be doing more theory-oriented machine learning. But I just felt that...I don't know, maybe it was too hard or I didn't see myself going down that route after about a semester into the masters. So yeah. Then I focused on computer vision and its applications. 

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?** 

So what kind of story are we talking about here? Like for a particular class or just anything related to academics in general?  

**Anything related to academics in general.**  

Um, okay. Just trying to remember stories...I think the most learning I've had, or the most fun I've had doing a particular course would have to be this advanced computer vision course.  

That was interesting because it just made me feel like I was like a graduate student. Most other classes just felt like you were doing courses and exams and so on. In this class, we'd just discuss research papers every class, right? And then you were supposed to think about and work on a research problem, and that for me was a really interesting exercise because I had to come up with an idea, which I thought would work, and then justify why I think it would work and then work on it and get it to work at least in some basic "stage one" way. Yeah, it just gave me a good overall mini-research experience, which felt really nice. So I think that would be the most memorable time I've had specifically at UofM.

I mean, if it was before that, the experience in Europe was really interesting as well. But at UofM, I think it was that course.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

So I've had two contrasting semesters. The first semester I had a bunch of courses, and I was looking for internships and stuff. Plus I had this grader position of 20 hours, so it was just too much. Um, I probably worked at least 10 or 12 hours a day that semester. Maybe even more, I don't know. Then in winter semester, it was quite, um - it wasn't as stressful, I think. There were days where...well, I don't think I worked more than six, seven hours a day this past semester. So yeah.  

70 I guess in the fall semester and like 40 to 50 second semester per week.

**Okay. What is the average number of waking rest hours you get per week in an average semester? Waking rest being time that you take off during the day.**  

Okay, probably again - in fall it was probably a couple of hours where I would just watch something, just one or two hours in the fall semester. And then in the winter semester...so by rest, you mean anything not related to academics, right? So sports for example?  

**Yeah, whatever you would consider rest.**  

Yeah, I would consider sports as rest as well. So yeah, in the winter semester it was more like three or four hours a day. But fall semester, two hours.  

**So roughly 14 and then 21 to 28?**  

Yeah. 

**And you've only had two semesters here, right?**  

Yeah. The first semester I was in India, so it was very different, I guess. It was more like the winter semester, which I had here, because I didn't have too much work at that time.  

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

Probably around 70, a little over 70. Like 10 to 12 hours consistently across the week, even including Saturdays and Sundays. So, yeah, about 75 I think.  

**Can you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Um, yeah. So for instance, so most of let's say Sunday would involve grading stuff. Then the rest of the week, at least from let's say Monday to Friday would be regular academics, like assignments, classes, all that stuff. Plus I'd have, let's say if there was an interview coming up during that week, I'd have to prepare for the interview, right? So it'd be mostly that. Then if it's towards the end of the semester, which I think happened once - so you have exams to worry about and then you have your projects due that week. So yeah, it would be just constant work throughout the week, I guess. I don't know if that was very specific, but...yeah. I don't recall much, but I just knew that I'd be awake for almost like, let's say pretty early in the morning, like about 10 or 11, to 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM in the morning. So yeah, something like that.  

**Okay. How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I think currently I have a pretty decent amount of control. So should I be talking during semesters or now? Because now we are in this break period.  

During the semester...I think I would still say pretty high, like 70, 80%, I think. Because I mean, I pretty much schedule according to how I want it to be. If there are classes and I have something else which is more important, I wouldn't hesitate to skip classes and do them later. So yeah, about 70, 80%, I guess. It would be mainly me deciding what I want to do for the day. There'd be only a few classes where you'd have quizzes in the class, which you would have to attend. Like there'd be some activity in the class, and you would have to go, but otherwise I pretty much decide how my schedule is gonna look like.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**

Um, yes. So at least this is what I felt myself: I thought when I was doing work for my master's that I wasn't enjoying it as much as I did in my undergrad. I mean, I think that was mainly because your interest in a particular field probably declines over time, unless you keep finding new things to do. Yeah, I kind of felt that some parts of machine learning and deep learning were kind of repetitive, things I've probably done before. So I wasn't as interested in that. I think that made it really hard for me to work as much as I did before in undergrad? 

Like undergrad was just, um, energy and enthusiasm, so I would almost unknowingly stay up all night working on something, fixing stuff, and I'd be okay. But I didn't feel like I had that sort of energy in me when I was doing things for my master's. But then I realized it sort of comes and goes. When you're doing something interesting - like I was still able to channel that energy, I guess, and put in the required number of hours. But at times it was hard because I didn't feel it was that interesting, compared to before.

**Sort of relating to what you just said: did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, like I said, it felt that it was just too hard to work on machine learning. I felt like I was interested in other stuff more. And I kind of felt that was just me being lazy, which could also be true, but I did notice there was something odd or different about me. I just didn't feel that I was at my peak productivity or enthusiasm.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, I don't think so. What I felt was that getting good academic results, in terms of grades and everything, wasn't really hard. For me, it just felt that if I put in some effort, I would be able to get good grades. That's also, I guess, just something which has, like, been with me: if there's like a grade or academics involved...I don't know. You somehow - er, I somehow end up taking that pretty seriously. So I felt that in terms of academic results there was just no change from undergrad to masters.  

**Okay.**  

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

So I usually tend to have almost unrealistic expectations or goals, but, um, that's just me, I guess. I'm not too worried if I don't achieve those goals: so for instance, I remember for one of our courses, we were actually asked to list down some of the - well, this was non-academic though. Yeah, some non-academic goals which we planned to complete during the course of the semester. I don't think I did a lot of them; there were plans involving travel and playing sports and all these other kinds of stuff. So I don't think I achieved or did most of them. I did probably a couple or found a compromise which sort of helped me partially tick off a goal, but...yeah. So in terms of setting up goals, I do tend to have somewhat unrealistic goals, but I'm not too stressed out if those aren't met.

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

I did feel so. I mean, I think I was pretty good at, yeah, of course machine learning - because...I mean, I did really well in my tests and was one of the few people who got an A. So I mean, I do think I was somewhat good at least in machine learning. I felt that choosing math, for instance, and having that background just helped me. I think I did better in some of these courses than others, like I was the one who scored the highest in the machine learning course when I took it.  

I think apart from that...I was good in many other fields as well. Like I was good in math, and I also felt that I was good in abstract stuff in math. I could understand those things which are really hard to put your eyes in, in a way, and I had this ability to sort of prove proof statements, I guess, which is probably not natural to many. So I mean, just like, how to arrive at this conclusion, given what we have - like what you would have to fill in to achieve what we set out to prove. I think I was pretty good at that. But yeah, those were a couple of things, which I felt I was pretty good at.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**

At UofM? I do pressurize myself every now and then to kind of like work harder than usual? That's just me wanting to do well, and yeah, because like I said, I have this feeling that I somehow just, like, worked much harder in undergrad and I was able to put in a lot of work. And I think to be sort of successful, you just have to put in that consistent amount of effort and just work hard. Also I do pressurize myself every now and then, especially when I'm kind of slacking off. And I feel like, "Okay, this is not how it should be". So I do pressurize myself if I have to.

**What is your relationship with failure?**

Um, yeah. So it's been...it's changed over time. I think when I was in undergrad, I would be pretty stressed out, and I would want to do something to somehow get me out of it. I remember I'd be, uh, very upset or even angry at times at myself for like, not doing enough or whatever. I don't get what I was looking for. But over time, I think I've become a bit more composed, a little more in peace with myself, and I've started  focusing on what I can do and what needs to be done and whether or not I'm doing that. So as long as I feel that I'm improving and I'm doing my best, I don't think the results affect me as much as they did before in undergrad.  

But...on the flip side, sometimes I feel that maybe I'm not, um, let's say passionate enough. That I should actually be feeling a lot worse than I am or something. That's there. Most times, it's me just trying to find something else or looking for the next opportunity or the next thing to do when I have failures. It's not as stressful as before.  

**Mm-hmm. How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I mean, I usually just shrug it off because I kind of feel that I'm not doing anything really extraordinary. I just feel that I'm doing what kind of feasibly is possible and...well, it's more like I'm just doing it and it's not anything extraordinary, so I don't think I usually accept any sort of praise in general. I guess I'm like, happy for a brief  fraction of a second when somebody compliments me, but that's about the extent. I mean, I don't think any sort of praise stays with me post-that. Yeah.  

**Okay. What feelings do you have when you succeed?** 

When I do succeed, when I do feel that I've done enough, um, I'm just more content...yeah, just content. I think that I put in the work and that I was able to find a solution and get the job done. Yeah, I'd say content pretty much sums it up.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

So yeah, the people around me...are of course happy, and I'm happy too as well. If I do have any sort of success, I would probably call my parents and then tell them, and they'd be like, "Yeah, that's good". And they're pretty happy as well. But in general - I think especially my parents - they're probably a lot happier with my successes than I am.

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Um, I would just define it to be this, um, this period where you just work a lot. Either it's peer work or something which you decide to do on your own. Basically it's just a period of prolonged work where you don't get to do much other than work, and at the end of it, you feel devoid of energy. That's probably how I define burnout.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yeah, I've heard imposter syndrome before.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Um, for me it would be just looking at your peers or the people who you compare yourselves to be, and then every time they have their successes or you feel like they're doing well, you sort of compare yourself and if you're not doing as well, or if you feel that you need to be better - I mean, just that feeling of trying to improve or compare or just being affected by your peers and their work and what they're doing. Yeah, that's probably how I'd define that.

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah I have. So towards the end of last semester, I felt pretty burnt out. I just wanted to be done with this semester and get a few days off. So I felt that I think at least at UofM, my most recent experience would have to be the end of last semester. I was pretty, in a way, surprised that I somehow was able to come out of it. It was just too much work towards the end of last semester. By last semester, I meant the fall semester. 

But yeah, fall semester. 

**Okay. Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah, I do. Pretty often also. I don't know, I just feel that it's sort of hard not to compare yourself against peers, especially with how connected we are with everybody around us. Like you get to know what people are up to. So yeah, I do...I mean, I do compare myself, but I don't know if it really affects me that much? Like I said, I think over time I've sort of developed this ability to be more in peace with myself and just focus on what I should be doing and what my journey is. And not really be bothered by people around. Although...it is a hard - it's a hard thing to do. But I dunno, somehow I think, um...like I said, it was harder in undergrad than it is now.  

**Hmm. Okay.**  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

If I had to guess, I would say pretty prevalent. Because I mean, I've heard from my friends telling me that they felt exhausted as well, when they talk about their previous semesters as well. They work pretty much all throughout the day as well, and they kind of feel like they need a break as well. So I think burnout is pretty common amongst most of the people who I talk to, at least.

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

Probably pretty much the same answers. I think people do end up discussing others a lot more than they should, at least that's what I feel when I talk to a few people. And I've talked to a couple of juniors, my juniors as well, and they...are just too worried about what people are doing and how they should be at, almost at the same place or somewhere near where others are. So yeah, I think it's somehow, um, pretty common and then pretty widespread, I'd say.

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

I mean, honestly, I don't know if COVID or these times specifically how - I don't know the kind of influence they've had. It is definitely an overlap with the period from which I shifted from undergrad to my master's. So I think that was more of a change, and I don't know if the pandemic being there put things into perspective and I became more sort of, um, cognizant of other more important factors, so to say? But I don't know if it had anything to do with the pandemic specifically or just me sort of maturing. It's really hard to gauge its influence on me. 

Yeah, for me, the pandemic has had more of the other kind of influence? Because I was in Europe and then the pandemic hit, there were a lot of things which I wanted to do which I just couldn't. So basically the only way it has affected me is I wasn't able to have fun and do things which I wanted to, like travel or other stuff, as much as before. Like, um, I'll be out of my twenties pretty soon, and I don't want to not do a lot of the things which I feel like I should be doing. So I mean, I've put a bit more priority to other things as well, like fitness and traveling, probably because of the pandemic. But in terms of burnout and imposter syndrome, I don't know how they've directly affected any of them. But there could be an indirect influence, which I probably have to analyze more. Yeah.  

**Just a few more questions: considering everything we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Some parts of it, yes. But the things which I feel I don't enjoy anymore, I think - like I found more enjoyment in terms of anything academics-related during my undergrad days. But I think my source of enjoyment and happiness have sort of turned to things outside. Like I play sports a lot more and I'm focused on fitness and other stuff more. So I guess there has been a decline in my, um, interests in academics in general, and that interest has shifted onto other things.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I was conscious of them. It's just that I...I don't think I had enough time to burn out. Okay, I guess I should tackle both of them differently...

In terms of burnout, I didn't really, like, think about that too much. I mean, I just felt that was just part of undergrad. And I knew that there were people who were just working harder than me, so I mean, I just wanted to work hard. I didn't really feel that exhausted, except for these brief periods on weekends where you feel like, "Okay, I've done enough for the week. Let's just go out, have some fun and come back." But they didn't have a prolonged effect on me during undergrad. 

In terms of imposter syndrome, there was this conscious effort on my side to keep these things in mind, that what I'm experiencing is pretty normal and that I should feel better; and I think I talked to a couple of people about this. I talked to my parents and other people, yeah. Overall, I was pretty aware of at least impostor syndrome. I don't think I dealt with it as well as I do now - at least that's what I think.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

So I mean, in terms of imposter syndrome, I think I have the same advice to everybody, even to juniors who I've sort of talked to. It's pretty much the same philosophy which I have, just to be focused on yourself and like what you think your next step should be, and just working on them instead of trying to look at it from a results perspective or from what others are doing and where they're at.

I think a lot of people, including me, overthink about all kinds of stuff. What I think helps is to look at short-term goals and short-term things which you want to do, and give it all you have on those particular things and not really be, um, focused on the end product. If you enjoy the process enough, I think you'll be happy long-term. Because even when you have successes or failure states - successes in particular; I mean, at least for me, I tend to be happy only for a very brief period, and then it's like it didn't even happen. So yeah, it's more about enjoying the process, I guess. And in terms of burnout, um...I don't know. I just think that...  

Again, this is kind of the people who I've talked to and met. People come here with the expectation that they'll do a lot of things in just one semester, like I'll take 4 courses, do research, play sports, and do everything. And people just find that's just not possible given the amount of work they have to put in. At least this is for people coming from India, because we don't have as much assignment-related work, I think, for our courses. Or as many homeworks. So it's just being prepared mentally, and also to have realistic expectations, I guess, in terms of what you want to achieve for the semester. Because that could also be a source of unhappiness. 

And also - I have to give advice to myself...I would probably, at least - during my first semester, I sort of neglected anything else, like sports or fitness-related things. So I would probably tell myself to account for that time as well, and to plan or schedule courses while keeping those things in mind. Yeah. That's all.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

I don't know, I think we pretty much covered most of the things. I guess...I did mention this when I was talking about imposter syndrome: it's just easy to get, just get lost with what achievements you wish you had. Like "I wanted this job", or "I wanted a paper out", or "I wanted to have this and that". It's easy to get lost in that and forget about what you need to be doing, and enjoying the process. So for me, just thinking about it in terms of really small steps and focusing on those things tend to really help a lot. You may not see the end, and it's not even necessary for you to know where the finish line is. It's more about just doing what you think the next step should be, or the next mile. Yeah, that's pretty much it.  

**Alright, that's a wrap then. Thank you for participating; I will stop the recording here.**  

Yeah.
