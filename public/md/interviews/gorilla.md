**As a warmup, tell me a little bit about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

So I went to high school here in Michigan and I feel like it was fairly normal. Uh, felt normal as much as normal can be. I worked a lot during high school, and I was one of the top of my class. Not *the* top, but one of the best. I took, uh, I think it was like five AP classes? So it was intensive, somewhat, but not too hard.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Hmm, okay...let's take about six to seven, maybe.

**How many years have you been in your major?**  

Like from when I declared my major? Shoot. Uh, I believe...I declared in either my sophomore or my junior year. I think it was my sophomore year, so it's been about two years. Yeah. That had to be my sophomore year.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Okay. So when I first came to UofM, I thought I wanted to do engineering because I was good at math. Then I took physics 140 here and, uh, no longer wanted to do engineering! Did not do well. It was a bit of a wake-up call. One thing that I remembered in high school that I liked a lot was AP psych - I took that in my senior year of high school. But the thing is, I was like, "Oh, I'm good at math, I could do something with this. Let's try engineering stuff." But since I was still on the fence, I applied to LSA and got into LSA; I was never in the college of engineering. So then I started with the intent of doing these prereqs for whatever college of engineering has to do, and then I could transfer in a year or two. But then I took physics and said, "No, I'm not gonna do that". So then I looked back and it was like, "Okay, well what did I enjoy the most?" And what I enjoyed most was psychology. And I said, "Okay, if I'm gonna do psych, then I'm gonna go all the way", so I'm gonna get a doctorate. That's why I'm also doing pre-med.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from time at UofM?**  

Let's see...does it have to be good or bad?

**Either, whatever you count as memorable.**  

I think what I remember most was coming out of any of my physics exams, knowing I did terrible and just generally feeling like crap. Then I'd ask myself, "Okay, what did I do wrong?", and I would think, "Well, I did everything wrong". But then I'm just like, "Okay, focus a little bit", and I would try to go back and change how I studied. But whatever it was about physics just never clicked. Um, so I would say most memorable is definitely walking out of those exams feeling like crap. I think the most memorable one would be after I think it was the second or the third one, and it was that moment when I decided, "Yeah, engineering's not for me". That sticks out most in my mind.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

Let's see. Usually I'm going from the time I wake up to...I try to get done around five o'clock. And then I would also study for an hour or two, sometimes three on weekends. Or I would be doing readings as well. So if I had to put a number on it, it would probably be close to 40. Maybe 40, 50, could be more. But yeah, I'd have to say somewhere in that range.  

**Okay, and what was the average number of waking rest hours you had in that average semester per week?**  

So you're saying the time basically where I was awake, but not doing schoolwork? 

**Yep. Whatever you would consider rest.**  

Okay. I'd say I definitely sneak in like an hour or two, especially during remote semesters. Whenever I had in-between class time and I'm just like, "Oh boy, I'm really tired", I'd go lay on my couch and just watch stuff for a bit. So that'd be an hour a day. Then after five, after I make food, then I'd be left with about three to four hours to myself. So I'd say about four or five hours a day during the week, and then weekends would be maybe eight per day. So let's see, have to do the math on that one...about 36 I'd say. Not including sleep. That's a gross estimate, I should say.

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**

My busiest...ooh. It definitely tops 60. Maybe like 60, 70. Uh, I'd say busiest...I don't think I could name that; every semester's felt like my busiest semester. Actually I'm taking a spring semester right now, and I'd say like taking nine credits, uh, that's been pretty busy. I'd say regularly I'm working on stuff until 6:00 PM a lot of the time. And especially on weekends, most of the time I also have to do stuff, 'cause stuff is due that Monday and if I don't do it now, I won't have the chance to do it. So taking that in consideration, it'd probably be like 80 hours. Maybe. Well no, it can't be 80 hours, more like 70. Just thought about it a bit more.  

**And for that busiest semester, whenever that was, what was the average number of rest hours you got per week?**

Well, because a lot of it is in person, I'm on campus most of the time in class, so I don't really get as much time to rest. If I had to guess, because a lot of the time when I wake up it's like: eat something, go until four or five, and then that's rest time. After I make food, I'd say I have maybe four hours to myself a day, during the week. Then probably about eight per day on the weekend. So let's see, about four per day is 20 and - actually, weekends would probably be more like six now that I think about it. So about 32 maybe.  

**Okay. What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

Definitely topping 50, it'd definitely be an exam week. Because not only on top of other classes, but on top of those you have to prepare for the exam, one, and then two, take the exam. Which in a lot of sciences, like organic chemistry or bio, it's at night; and you know, that cuts into your time. So yeah, it'd probably be closer to 50, 60.

**Just checking: I believe you said 60 to 70 for your busiest average week in your busiest semester.**

So the busiest week in that semester would be - wait. Uh, let's see, may have been doing math wrong. There's a reason why I'm not an engineer. Okay, what did I say before? 

**I believe you said 60 to 70 before.**  

Alright, let's tone that down a bit. That probably should be 50, 60, and then in the busiest week it'd probably be over 60, if I had to put a number on it.  

**You mentioned exam weeks being atypically hard. Could you walk me through an example of one of those weeks?**  

Okay, it starts on the weekend. I basically do the bulk of my studying on Saturday, Sunday: so wake up and one: do whatever I have to do for any other class, which is typically doing a reading for the week. And then two, actually study, which usually is at least three, four hours, maybe. If it's a pretty good study session or if I get it, you know, it'll be a lot shorter. But if I'm still struggling to understand something, then it takes a lot longer. I think the most recent example I have is with, uh, I'm taking orgo 2 right now, and a lot of my study regimen for that is we have practice problems, and I'll work through a set amount of them on Saturday and Sunday each. Usually I end up studying for two, three hours depending on one: how much I do, and two: how long it takes for me to get through 'em.  

But I do that both Saturday, Sunday. And then again, like I said, I also have to do other things for other classes - or maybe even the same class, because especially in a spring semester it never stops with stuff to do. But even in normal semesters, I still usually have something else to do as well, which compounds, and usually that makes studying take longer I would say. Because I'm already a little tired from what I was doing before. So usually studying would take three, four hours each day, so total of six to eight on a weekend. And then after the weekend, I would have classes like normal, and typically exams are on Tuesday, Wednesday. So there's not a lot of time in the week to study other than, you know, maybe an hour or two before the exam you get those last minute notes down, you know?  

So typically Monday, I would go through basically a normal schedule, maybe look at the notes a little bit, review anything that I still think I might need some review on. But usually the next day it's exam time that night. So I'd just go through classes like normal and go "Ah crap, I got an exam later, I'm not looking forward to this", and then I'd get home and I would have maybe an hour or two to look at what I have to do. But I'd also in that hour or two...yeah, I need to look at notes, but also I want be rested a little bit, so I factor that in as well. And then, you know, go take the exam.  

And then after the exam, the week looks fairly normal. Uh, but you always have the post-exam dread. Just like, "I did so bad. Oh God, it's gonna be so bad." And you're just waiting on your results, even though it takes a week if it's all written. So just gotta wait. But honestly, other than that, it feels pretty normal.  

**Okay. How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

Honestly, it feels pretty small? Especially taking a spring semester, because it feels like I just have shit - sorry - a crap ton to do, and you know, I have to get that done. It's not like I can just wait and do it later. During a regular semester though, I feel like I have some control, like "Okay, if I don't do this now, I have time to do it later". I can schedule around it and say "This is what I need to do", I can get it done. And a lot of time, I have a lot more free time. But I definitely feel like it's a bit of a difference, especially what I'm doing right now - that's clouding how I feel about it. 

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Not really. I've always been kind of the person that pushes myself a bit in what I can handle, in terms of time commitments. As I mentioned before, I worked a lot in high school, and I worked a lot more than a person or a student probably should have. So I'm used to, you know, not having a lot of time for myself - not to say that that's a good thing. So when I came to college - well, that first semester I only gave myself 13 credits to kind of ease myself in. But I felt the same kind of attitude towards it, you know, just "This is just what I was doing in high school, but a little harder and I might have to change up some stuff, but I feel like I'm doing pretty good".  

For the most part, that stayed pretty constant until my next semester. But I would definitely say once COVID hit, my attitude kind of changed a bit, because at least in some classes, it definitely felt like some professors didn't care as much as others. That kind of soured it a little bit, but I still had the attitude of "I'm still going, I'm gonna try my hardest". And as time went on and people got more used to, you know, virtual learning, it got better. I think it got a little better once we started coming back in the following fall, so fall 2021, and then winter felt pretty good. Closer to what I felt pre-COVID.

So overall it'd be positive, but there was definitely a dip in the middle too.  

**Okay. Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

I wouldn't say so. I think it's been about the same. I feel about as energetic as I did before, I think. Compared to freshman year, I would definitely say I was a bit more outgoing, but I think it's a bit confounded by COVID. That's made it a little harder to be outgoing, so I wouldn't say that was a product of school getting harder and forcing me to stay in. Well, it was a bit of both. It wasn't solely one or the other.  

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Well, that first semester was a really hard semester, as I've mentioned with physics. So it dipped *quite* significantly from what I was used to. But then I took the next semester, and that's when I switched to doing psych, and that's when I found what I really liked. So it went right back up, and ever since, my grades have been pretty high.

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

When I set a goal, I try to be as realistic as I can, taking into account how I can be when I'm trying to accomplish something, and trying to think of what might get in the way, what else I might have to do? And typically I think that I'm able to accomplish them a lot. That's not to say I set low expectations for myself; I think in taking that more realistic approach, I'm able to see what I know I can do and how much I'm able to push myself. And I tend to set goals within that limit.  

**In your education before UofM, and you touched on this a little bit, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Oh, yes, for sure. I think my best example for this is that my paper that I wrote in 10th grade was used as an example paper by that teacher to teach, um, what to do right in a paper and even some things to do wrong. Two years later after I said, "Yeah, you can use that paper" as a joke, it actually showed up in my senior English class. The entire time I was looking at it - well one, I was like, "Oh god, I wrote this", and two, I was like, "Oh god, I could have done this so much better here and here and here and here. But anyway, that's the kind of student I was. I was the kind of student who would do so well I would set the standard in some ways. Of course, while acknowledging that part, I also was the kind of student who, when I failed, I would always try to look at what I did and see why I failed. And then I would use that information on that failure to make sure I didn't do it next time. That's been one of the guiding things as a student that I've taken in, because I've definitely taken after that "Failure is one of the best teachers", and that's what's made me into that student that sets the standard, because I worked and refined myself to be that student. It definitely wasn't easy.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

I don't think by UofM, but by myself, definitely. Because like I said in the last question, I was that student who set the standard because I made myself into that, pushed myself to be better. Definitely that thought also had a negative part on it. A lot of times when I'm trying to do a lot, like if I'm trying to do a lot of readings in one day, 'cause I'm just thinking "Okay, I gotta get this done now", I just start looking at it and get kind of sleepy-eyed and stuff, going, "Oh god, I'm just - I can't". But then I realize it and I'm like "Okay, I can't push myself like this, I gotta space this out".  

Again, falling back on failure, or at least not being able to accomplish that goal. I'll just be like "I know this doesn't work. What if I try to do it like this?" I try to figure out a way that will work. So while yes, I have felt like I have to be superhuman, that's by me. And then usually to me, when that blows up in my face - which isn't often, though it definitely happened a lot more as I was figuring out college and just how to conduct myself and how to, how to do college. But it served as a teacher, whenever those happened, to be better and organize what I had to do and realistically see what I can do.  

**You touched on this a little bit earlier: what is your relationship with failure?**  

Yeah, failure is a good teacher. It can be very crushing when you fail at something, especially when you thought you were doing really good at it. But I'm of the opinion that failure is a good teacher. So whenever I fail at something, I try to understand why: why did I fail at this? What did I do wrong? What can I do to be better? And very rarely has that approach ever failed me, like, as I've mentioned before, physics - whatever it was, I just couldn't get it down. But a lot of the time, if I take the time to reflect on what I did wrong, take the time to come up with a strategy to address that, and then take the time to work on that or to actually act on that strategy, it works out a lot for me and I'm able to achieve great things. That's a lot of what got me through high school and becoming that model student, and that's what's gotten me through college - getting high grades, especially after stumbling a little bit my first semester, and trying to find what I wanna do and getting through those tougher times when it's super busy and I need to figure out what's best for me.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I think there's a lot of ways I can take it. A lot of the time, I just like, you know, give a smile, thumbs up, and be like, "Yeah, I did that". You know? It's not exactly something I go around looking for a lot of the time, unless I want to say, point something out about something. Though I'm always willing to share a good exam score when I get it in a really hard class. I feel like that's something to be proud of, but I don't try to dwell on it too much because I think if I dwell on the past and what I've been in the past, it gets harder to focus on the future. There's more information coming, there's still another exam, you know. You can't stop now. I don't exactly go looking for praise a lot of the time, but when it occurs, I'm just like, "Oh, okay, cool. Thank you."  

**Okay.**  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

It feels a little bit like it's the expectation, at least in some classes. In other classes, like those hard sciences, when I succeed it's very, very exciting. Because you know, they're called hard sciences! They're very hard. So when something clicks in that, you just go, "Yes! Yes! It makes sense!"  

My best example for this is when I took physics 2 - of course this one was without calc. Unlike when I took physics one, I actually got a hundred percent on an exam, and I was so happy. I was jumping around my apartment just going like, "Yes, yes! I got a hundred on a physics exam! Let's go!" And just being all excited. 

However, that's not for every class. Especially within my own major, psych, I'm just like, "Yeah, that's what I'm expecting". Or with Latin as my language requirement for LSA - with Latin, I'm just like, "Yeah, that's what I expected". So it depends on the class for success. I'd say a lot of classes, I'm just like, "Yes, I succeeded, moving on". But with others, like those hard sciences, I'm just like, "Yes! I did well! Yes! Celebrate!"  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

It depends on who. There's definitely been people who, um, they're like happy for you, and say "Good job, you worked really hard". But then I feel like there's also people that are like, "Oh, good job" and within the back of their mind, they're just like, "Fuck". Er, sorry, they go "Crap. He's succeeding and I'm not." And part of me is just like "Ooh, maybe I shouldn't share that. It might make them feel bad." So part of it's a bit of a consideration of me and how they might feel, but most of the time I'd say people are generally positive towards it. Of course the negative reaction, they don't tend to share that towards me; it's just something I kind of pick up. So I mean, to that end, it might not even be there, it's just a general vibe I'm getting from it. But generally pretty positive.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Of course.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Basically when things you're passionate about start to feel like work. I guess I should clarify, but in my opinion, if you're doing something you love, it doesn't feel like work. It's fun. It's something that you love to do. Of course, even with passion, you gotta set your own limits and all that. But to me, when I do stuff like psych - I'm in a lab and I do study visits, and I like it a lot. To me it doesn't necessarily feel like work; it feels like, "I need to go do this, this is a fun opportunity, I can't wait to go do this". It's not like when I had a job, where I'm just like, "Aw crap, I gotta go work". You know? So to me, that point of burnout is when I reached that point when things that were like, "Oh yeah, I can't wait to go do this!" become "Aw, crap, I gotta go do this" and I start to just get exhausted and tired just thinking about it.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?** 

Yep. 

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

This one is one that I've had to define as an in-class assignment, and even then I think I struggled a bit to put it into words. From how I understand, it's a feeling when...how it feels to me is: you have this position, right? But you don't feel like you should be there. You don't feel like you've earned it. You feel like there are other people who should have been there instead of you, or you're just kind of like, "How the heck did I get here? Surely there's somebody else."  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Oh, for sure. I feel like I'm actually going through a little bit right now. As I mentioned, taking spring term for nine credits is *really* difficult, especially after these past few semesters, which have been getting pretty hard. It's just been a lot of work. I had the final two semesters of my language requirement. Those are every four days a week, one hour a day, daily homework - basically you're always doing something with it. And that homework could take an hour or so, and then you're just like "Well, crap, now I gotta go do the other stuff I have to do". 

Especially this past year has been pretty rough, and then taking this spring semester hasn't exactly helped. But because of how I did things with classes and requirements through LSA, if I didn't take this spring semester, I would be here a fifth year. In my mind, it was worth taking the spring semester more than the fifth year, mainly 'cause I can't necessarily afford a fifth year. I don't want to be here past spring 2023 and not have graduated already. 

So I definitely feel it a little bit. This last month I was already looking at this spring semester. I was just like, "Oh god, it's gonna be hard to get through". Yeah, definitely have had those feelings.  

**You talked a bit about this current spring semester, and you also talked about previous semesters in general. Are there any other specific instances of burnout you'd like to elaborate on?**  

I think I've hit the nail on the head a bit, at least during college. I felt burnout I think for the first time when I was in high school. Like I said, when I was there, I had a job, and I worked at that job way more than a high school student should've. I started to feel a lot of burnout, and my solution to that - I feel like I am a very responsible person, and a lot of the time when I got a paycheck, I just deposited it in my bank account, saved it. So I actually had a lot of savings built up. So what I did was once these feelings came up a bit, I thought, "How can I alleviate this? If I keep going like this, it's going to get way worse. I'm gonna burn out like crazy."

So I looked at the calendar and - it's a Mexican restaurant. So, I'm like, "I can't leave before Cinco. I'm not that kind of guy." I remembered mother's day is also pretty rough. So I was just like, "Alright, those days are right next to each other. I'm gonna tell my boss Mother's day, I'm out." 'cause I'm a senior in high school at this point, and if I don't do this, this burnout is gonna follow me throughout my entire college career.  

If I don't quit now, quit from all this dizziness and this pressure, it's gonna follow me throughout college and I'm not gonna have a fun time. So my strategy then was to just cut back in a very large way by quitting my job, which of course I was able to do because I had the savings. If I didn't do that, I feel like I would've been a lot worse off. Of course, completely withdrawing from college would not work right now! I think this burnout that I've been feeling during college has been a result of not taking enough breaks for myself. Especially during COVID semesters - for those that weren't taking classes during COVID, we would only get like a day or two off. Er, we had those stupid wellness days which were a day a month in the middle of the week, which I just worked through anyway because I had so much crap to do that I had to. so it's not like I really got a break at all.  

And then this semester, while we actually did get breaks, harder classes and taking a spring semester on top of that didn't help. So this one was a bit of a product of my own self, but at the same time I can't employ the same strategy. So I've been finding different ways to try and deal with it.  

**Okay. Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

I think a bit, definitely. As I mentioned, I'm part of a research lab, and I feel like that initial time when I'm there, I was just like, "Am I, like, allowed to be here? Am I the one supposed to be here?" But over time, I felt welcomed into the role a bit, and those feelings went away. So it didn't feel that big - it was maybe like the tiniest thing in the back of my head, but I don't think it was a big thing. I definitely felt it a little bit when I came to college, because I definitely was not used to being in such a big area. 

A lot of my time in high school, I spent it pretty introverted and didn't really talk to a lot of people. I had my reasons one way or another, but it definitely was a bit of a transition. Especially that first month or so, I was just like, "Should I really be here?" Just...it felt off. But over time, it was the same thing with my research lab: I got used to it and I felt, "Yeah, I truly belong here. I'm the one that should be here."  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I feel like it can be pretty common. Part of that which I keep referencing is COVID. That made it pretty hard to stay focused and really do what you wanna do, because it took away a lot of opportunities. Especially thinking about freshmen. People that I know who were freshmen, who came in that year. They didn't step foot on campus for the first time until last fall, and a lot of those feelings, especially with people that I talked to during that time, was just like...  

"Man, this is really sad. This makes it really hard to focus and be really committed and feel like I *do* this". And that made it a lot harder on people close to me too, because even if you're not an incoming freshman, it's a huge shift to go through. Not to mention other other family obligations or other life things that may be a part of that. So I feel like it's been pretty prevalent, even though some people might not show it.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

I think that is very prevalent. Especially in some people that I know, they feel like they shouldn't be here or shouldn't be where they are. I think it can be quite common, especially with such a prestigious school like UofM. That definitely raises the question, and I think it gets compounded if you tend to struggle a bit, because then you think "Why was I chosen to come here if I was just gonna do this?" So I feel like it can happen pretty often among my peers. Though when it does, I try to say like, you know...you may not think that you're supposed to be here, but someone did, because they saw there was potential. So you have the potential to do good. It's tough, especially during COVID, but if you try, you can figure it out. You can do it. A bit beyond the question there, but yeah.

**You've brought this up quite a bit already, but how do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Oh, it has increased it for sure. I've mentioned this as well, but it's difficult to say whether an increase in burnout or imposter syndrome was due to being in college or just COVID, because COVID has made things so much worse than they would've been otherwise. So it's difficult to say where that source comes from, and they definitely compound with each other. So COVID has definitely increased feelings of burnout and imposter syndrome.  

**We are almost done, just a couple more questions. So considering everything we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Oh yeah, sure. It's been tough, don't get me wrong. There have been many falls and failures, but as many falls and failures I've had, I've had many more heights and successes. I think one of the greatest things that I get out of this is being part of my research lab and being able to work with participants in the study that I do. That's been one of the most rewarding things, because I get to work with people and actually be part of research. That's been one of the most enjoyable things.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I definitely knew about burnout, because like I said, I was feeling it during. I don't think I called it burnout, but I definitely knew the feeling before I came here with my job. Imposter syndrome, I didn't really hear about that until I got here. I mentioned I had to define it for a class, and I feel like that was the first time I really tackled or heard about the issue. So yeah.

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I'd tell them, don't be stupid, don't take that astronomy class, take another class in your freshman year. Those are the main reasons why I'm feeling burnout now, because I took classes that weren't exactly what I needed to take and didn't take another class. Right now, my other two classes other than orgo are catch-up to do those requirements, and that's part of what's making it so hellish. So I'd definitely tell myself for the love of god, don't take that astro class. You'll be fine, just don't do that. <laugh> But in all seriousness, basically think more about how you organize your schedule. That's mainly just the point that needs to be hit on with my past self, because that's definitely what's messed me over now.

**Is there anything you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

I think we've hit on a lot of it.  

**All right, cool. Thank you for your time and I'll stop the recording here.**
