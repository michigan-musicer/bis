**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

So that would really just be high school. It was one of the better-off public schools in the state of Michigan, did very well there - cat, come here! Did very well there in high school. Took a multitude of AP courses, involved in extracurriculars, was very busy. But never felt, in high school, particularly swamped - more just full. I was personally very happy with my high school experience pretty much across the board.

Then beyond UofM, I took a couple of classes at a local university across two summers, just to get some smaller classes out of the way.  

**Approximately how many people did you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I would say that definitely changed over time as classes became more and more narrow. In engineering, I think the largest course is EECS 280, and either the year or the semester after me, there were upwards of a thousand kids in that class. I'd say it kind of got down to peers...  

So I went for three years. In my first two years, I would say the people around me weren't necessarily at what I would say peer status. I would say we're doing similar things, 'cause there's still a lot that you can vary off of into different degrees. But I would say in my third year, it felt more like the kids in my third year were peers, where the class sizes are down to 30 to 50 or you're doing a capstone or whatnot.

But yeah, definitely when classes were down into the double digits - or when I took a lot of language courses, so doing upper level language courses - definitely felt like *those* were my peers.  

**And do you have an approximate final count on that?**  

Are you asking cumulative over the course of, like, how many people at the end, once I graduated, would I consider to have been my peers throughout the time?  

**Give me a specific count that you had at one time. So if peers fell out, then, um, yeah.**   

I would probably use my last year to define it because anything before that just seems way too large of a group.

I don't know, I'd say there are probably a hundred people, say, that are probably pretty close to me on the engineering, computer science side of things? Where I'd see them pop up a lot more or just casually mention something, maybe share a couple of classes. Then in my language courses, I'd say there were probably 10 to 15 people that kinda stuck through it past the first required year or whatever. I would say they were my peers as well - so about a hundred from engineering and 10 to 15 from that little language subsection.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your major?**  

I went to UofM for three years. I was declared computer science I think after my first semester, because I had a decent amount of credit coming in and I met that requirement. So I think two and a half years, I was technically considered a computer science major on that path.

But I was in the college of engineering the whole time.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

Senior year of high school I took - wait? No. Junior year of high school I took our AP programming class and really enjoyed it. I've always really enjoyed video games, both playing competitively and kind of learning nuance. For example, most of my streaming was doing speedrunning, which takes a lot more of an in-depth look at the mechanics of a game and the baseline, why these things are happening on a programmatic level. That was really interesting to me, and it was not necessarily that...I think when I was in high school, it wasn't necessarily that I knew that I wanted to make games. It was more like this aspect of gaming, this speed running and this competitive nature, were interesting and stimulating to me. And I liked that and I wanted to continue to have that interesting stimulation.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Most of it was honestly out of major - er, at least the things that are coming to my mind right now. I'll give you three and they're all from different aspects. Number one was how I got my job - it was at the UofM game jam or whatever game showcase that we did. We put together our little game, which was very different from a lot of other people. A lot of people at the game showcase did 2D things, and we did something in 3D. Um, it wasn't a great product, but two people from the company that I now work at were there, they were looking for a Unity programmer to join the team because they really only had one-and-a-half.  

So me and someone else on my team ended up talking with the guys. I ended up going forward, he didn't, and that's how I got the job - in a time where I was not confident about getting a job, at all. I kind of just stumbled into that, and it was a very easy transition period afterwards. I guess the other things out of major...there was a professor that I really liked. Through high school, I would really enjoy a lot of the professors or teachers that people didn't like. I liked the no-bullshit professors that say, "This is how it's gonna go. I'm gonna be incredibly transparent, but incredibly blunt." And that was a professor in material science, and he was very entertaining.  

He was really funny. We got along well. And then I guess my last memorable thing was I also got along with all of my language professors, and my exam for my third semester, up at the front were all the professors and I had each them for my first semester, my second semester, my third semester. And I walked up to hand in my exam and they all smiled at me and recognized me, and there was a supportive energy between all four of us. It was really cool 'cause I had all of them. That was comforting, I guess.  

**Okay. What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

Oh, hell if I know. I mean, it definitely changed over time...or did it? Well...I definitely did not - I didn't go out much, but I also wasn't very inclined or interested in going out much. I would say including the in-class time as well, probably like, I would say 40 sounds like a reasonable number.

There were definitely classes that were imbalanced. But oh well, that happens.  

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester, waking rest being defined as time you're taking off during the day?**  

Waking rest hours per week...I would say probably four to six per day, which would be 20 to 30. That's only me thinking about the weekdays; if I add weekends, maybe like another...I'm trying to think of all the different times, over all the different semesters as well. I think I would say 40. I don't know. I never felt like I had a lack of time, just a lack of motivation. So yeah, I'd say 40.  

**Okay. What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

That would've probably been one of the senior year semesters. That probably would've been up around 50. That sounds accurate to me.  

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week that semester?**  

I'd probably just say 30. Just subtract it out.  

**Okay. What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

What would this be?...65 sounds reasonable.  

**Can you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**  

I would imagine that this would've been the first semester of my senior year. I had - actually, I have my transcript. Hold on. I have my transcript downloaded that I could take a look at...here we are, Michigan transcript. So my first semester of senior year was...so I had a capstone, I had the hardest rated EEECS course at the university, I had major design professionalism, technical communication, and then a theater class? Which really, the - I mean, I can imagine we have theater, which would be probably five or six hours on its own; the tech-comm would be three, the design professionalism - that was a garbage class - that was like three. So we're looking at 12, and then if say, something for game design and 381 ran together, then yeah, it would be...basically overlapping projects on two core programming courses I think would definitely come together and make that.

Yeah. Cause the side stuff, that wouldn't really inflate much. But the core classes coming together and being a mess would probably do it.

**How much control do you feel you had over how you spent your time?**  

A lot, but I think that's primarily because...let's see. I'm looking at my transcript now so I'm hopefully able to remember a little bit. I mean...hmm. How much control do I have over how I spend my time...I think I would say the moments where I felt like I was like lacking control was mainly when I would be frustrated with either the procedures to do something or - a lot of the stuff in EECS was using autograders and using tests and different parameters that, um - I found a lot of frustration with nitpicky aspects.

One of my courses in my last year was a lot of nitpicking and code readability, and that course I mentally wrote off very early on. I think I would've spent a lot more time on that course if I did not mentally check out of it as soon as I did. 'cause that still was a pain, and I think I felt like I had a good amount of time, but I felt like my lost time wasn't necessarily due to any length or raw difficulty of something, more to just being frustrated with...I don't know, the mechanics that something exists around or just some nuanced instruction that's being a pain.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

I went into it with a change. I graduated high school getting...I never even got an A-, I had absolutely perfect straight As. And I went into college with the preexisting mindset of "You are not going to get straight As", and I don't think that really helped me. That was something that I don't know if I put it on myself or my parents mentioned it where it's like, "It's okay if you don't get straight As" and that I think kinda made me more inclined to cruise? Which was also completely opposed to the goal that I set for myself of graduating in three years. So those things didn't really help one another. I mean, obviously I'm here. I did it in three years, so I got there. But I went in with the mindset of...not "Cs get degrees", but "Gimme anywhere from, uh, a 2.7 to a 4.0, I'll be happy in a given class".  

And I think that was not the mentality to start with. Then also, because I wanted to graduate in three years, I did not really care for a social life. A lot of the people that came with me from high school had different personal goals when it came to socializing. And then, yeah, my first semester of my senior year - the 381 class and that professor, I don't remember his name, but that class just broke me. And I felt like my efforts were futile in that.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

I think I was fine through the first two years. And then yeah, it was the third year - the apartment we were in was in the basement of an apartment complex. Literally we were below the dirt that was outside. It was very dark. And my goal was, "This is my last semester, let's just hunker down and not do anything", but that's very counterproductive. So yeah, it was just my second to last semester where my energy died out; and then my last semester, I'm like, "Okay, we failed a class, now we need to get going". And it came back up for that.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Well, I got my transcript, so let's take a look...I'll say the term-by-term GPAs and then kind of give my thoughts as well. 'm gonna route into the 10th. It went 3.6, 3.4, 3.4, 3.6, 3.0, and then 3.3. I think from what I've been saying as well: the first two years were pretty solid. I was comfortable how much I was getting out of it and where I was going. My first two years I was on north campus as well. I enjoyed north campus. I grew up kind of in the woods, outside; so I liked a little bit of distance from downtown. I was able to walk to the cafeteria and eat. So I think that those were also just more comfortable locations. And then the last year was worse, but I did make a recovery on the last semester.  

 **Okay. Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic were they and how consistently could you accomplish them?**  

I think I set up myself pretty sparing goals from what I remember. Really, my only overarching goal was graduate in three years. Just graduate in six semesters, get out there, get going. I never really set myself goals in terms of internships or connections, networking...not failing a class probably wasn't an explicit goal of mine. Implicitly, I did, uh, looking back, definitely would not have wanted to fail a class. <laugh> But I think...I may not have rebounded with that at 110% strength, but it's something that happened, and I think I am better for it. And I have made changes since then in some areas that I know specifically were impacting my performance. So I think yeah, I didn't set too many goals. But considering that one probably being a major setback, I'm happy with how I rebounded from it. But yeah, I didn't set anything crazy. I just had the one overarching goal, I think.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or especially strong student?**  

Yes. I was very good in high school. In recent years, I've been wondering, "Did I peak in high school?" I felt like I had *a* peak in high school, but I hope it is not the highest I will ever go. But yeah, I was very strong both academically and socially in high school.  

**Did you ever feel pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Later on. I think at the start, I came in with the mentality of, "I know I'm not going to be able to match those standards. This is going from, you know, the big fish, big pond situation, and this is an ocean." And I, from the start, did not want to compete in the ocean. But as it got to the last year, where I am recognizing my peers and I'm realizing these *are* people who I am competing with, it has been narrowed down and I can see who my competition is. I definitely felt a lot more pressured. Like I felt - and I probably did this wrong - I felt a lot less social. Not necessarily combative, but I wanted to succeed over others. I didn't want to put others down; I just didn't necessarily want to, like...I didn't want to be behind others when it was that late. In my head I was saying, "This is supposed to be my last year, I need to be ahead".  

**What was your relationship with failure?**  

I would say primarily...I don't wanna say I failed at being social, 'cause I didn't particularly try the hardest. It wasn't necessarily an objective of mine, but I definitely could have done better socially, in continuing relationships, some good relationships that were established early on; but I was just disinterested and still holding onto that track of "these three years have one purpose, and that is to start the fourth year". In terms of, uh, academically, I'd say the only big failure would be failing a course and then very much realizing "Okay, we need to make some changes". And I'm very glad that I was able to identify that. I think I viewed the consequences of failing a course to me with my goal were much more severe than, I guess, losing some relationships. 

Some of those people that I continued with from high school to UofM, like I still had a lot of, I guess, social capital and history built up with them. So I was confident that wasn't gonna fade. Even make some friends that we had met through college or friends of friends - I felt like I hadn't necessarily failed in that department. And so because I felt like I didn't fail, I didn't feel like I needed to make any drastic changes. But when I failed a course, that kind of got in the way of my primary goal. That was the push to make more drastic changes.  

**How did you react to academic praise from others?**  

I'd say very positively early on. I'm remembering, er, at least in the school of engineering, you have to take an intro to engineering course, which in my case, it was very professionalism and presentation-focused. The praise and feedback throughout that course - granted, I feel and felt pretty comfortable with my public speaking and presentation skills at that point, so having that reinforced by someone who was a doctor felt very good. I would say that I don't really know even how much room there is for praise and like, words of affirmation in EECS, right? Because everything's just so project-based and coding-based. Your results in these courses are summed up in either an autograder, or in some courses where they're grading for style or everything's super exam-based in a paper that you get back - I feel like in the EECS courses, there was no face-to-face time where praise could even occur.  

 Now in the language courses that are smaller, where you have to present, where you have to speak, where there's a lot more nuance that you can do in the moment, right? When I submit my project, there's not really...I don't know. It's just, nuance and detail and the *feel* of something is just so much different than talking to someone in a presentation or in another language. So I felt like I experienced much more praise doing presentation and language courses, primarily in other fields than in programming.  

**What feelings did you have when you succeeded?**  

Relief? I like to get very animated, very pumped up physically. I'm a, I don't wanna say surprisingly emotional, but...I am an emotional person, but I tried to subdue that and quiet that a decent amount. That has changed a little bit since then. But yeah, I felt like when something works, there's that click, and that's something to repeat again.  

It's just...to me, it's very much the thought of "If it worked once, then it'll work again". Maybe not exactly, but the core fundamentals to that approach or that decision. That's also a bit of...I don't wanna say a bit of the speedrunning stuff that I did in my free time, but that's incredibly repetitive, and so being able to replicate things over and over and getting that down to a T is rewarding. And seeing the results come through and feeling like, "Okay, we have the pattern!" Yeah. It felt like I was establishing and discovering the pattern.  

I will say I don't think I ever cried from relief. I don't think I ever cried from success. There was probably a time as I was failing 381 that I did cry, but I think also I very quickly transitioned to, like, "I know I am failing this", and that somewhat just superseded any emotion coming out of failing in that.  

**How did you think others reacted when you succeeded?**  

I think it really...so the people that I actually had interactions with to where they could see my success were people in my language courses, where the class size was small enough. I was also proficient in the language, and then some friends that I was helping with in a class that I already took - I just feel like most of the times when I felt like I succeeded, I was with people that I considered myself, like, "further progressed than". I believe they all would've acted positively and found that interesting, but I think I didn't put much weight in it. Because I understood the interpersonal dynamic already where...at least from my perspective, I already thought that, like - I expected this of myself already in those relationships, where that success could be seen. But in the larger classes, I just felt like I was the only one to witness my success.

And then in the smaller ones, in most of those situations I already expected success out of myself. So it kind of put a damper on it, like "Yeah, this is okay". It felt good and it made me more confident in that subject, but it's also kind of what I expected of myself after a time.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes. 

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Burnout is when you continue working at a rate higher than your rate of recovery, and your work is impacted by it negatively.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Feeling like you are in a position out of a series of chance. That you are underqualified - or even that you are overqualified - that you don't belong in this role and you are in this role or position due to a few coin flips that you didn't have control over.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah, I must have. I guess...I just wouldn't say that I viewed it or experienced it in what I defined burnout as, or...no, that is what it is. Yeah. I experienced burnout. I think in my fifth semester, I felt like I was mitigating, er, I felt like I had found a way to mitigate burnout. For example, improving the recovery, or having a more enjoyable recovery experience. But that was not the case, and instead it decreased my work time, increased my recovery time, and made my recovery less effective. And I thought that this was something that I could either handle or would improve things, and it did not.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yes.  

**How so?**  

That would've been when I got my job, because that was the only job offer I received. And it was for a startup company that paid hourly. I was written up as a contracted worker at this absolutely tiny company, maybe like five or six full time people? Absolutely minuscule. And even then I was thinking, "This is the one gig that I got". If, say I got five offers, I would've been able to choose and pick a place that I felt most confident in. But I had one choice, and it wasn't even much of a choice, because the thought of not having a job in my field was a non-starter. That has come a long way. I no longer feel like an imposter at my job.  

I've kind of been able to step back and really take a look at things: "What is going on? What is the role that I play?" And my role has dramatically increased. I'll still get - and also I have been working remotely all of my career. Never had an office, never had a place to go to. That also was like, "Okay, is my work from home work-life balance appropriate?" 'cause I didn't have anything to base it off of. I just had all of the work-facing personas of my coworkers, right? And when you only see your coworkers working, then you think, "Well, shit, I'm not working", or "I'm not working as much as I think that I can or should or want or want to" on a surface-paper level. But I've gotten a lot better at realizing that I only see a snippet of my coworkers.  

And there are times that I may have just not paid attention. There are times when coworkers are not always on it 24/7, or there are times where people are performing better or worse than they usually do or better or worse relative to one another, or just whatever they happen to be doing. So I've gotten a lot more comfortable with variance in general, 'cause I think that's what it is. That you expect to always be at the top, and then sometimes you're at the bottom. That gap sucks, but that gap isn't always that much.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout was among your peers?**  

I would say high. I think from my personal friends, thinking back, there are definitely situations where...I think sometimes I'm trying to decipher between "is someone burned out or are they overpreparing, and maybe they are the same", right? Someone who's very anxious about a test or an exam or project and is putting extra time into that - that might be burnout, because you know, they're worried about something and they're putting in more hours or less efficient hours. I've had a lot of friends change majors or just change plans and objectives altogether, and that very easily could have been the product of that. I don't think I had a...like, I only ever had two roommates. I don't think I ever had a roommate that suffered from burnout, at least visually. But then also, I was trying to figure out "Is this normal", right?  

Is this just, are we just busy? I think that's one of the hardest things, right? You're 19 years old and trying to determine "Am I overworked?" Looking back, I *definitely* can't decipher whatever memories and emotions that I had, looking back at interactions with people. I mean, they're taking it, so they signed up for this, right? So they must have been...but it's a lot to ask from people. A lot of casual conversation was centered around classes and having to do things, doing projects and activities back-to-back. A lot of casual conversation was centered around work, if I remember correctly. So yeah.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome was among your peers?**  

A lot of people second-guess computer science. There were a lot of people I talked to where they either dropped it completely, only wanted a minor and still dropped, changed from a major to a minor, got the major and still were questioning themselves all the way through. Even I, going into my second year, I'm like, "Should I have done data science?" I think because it's, um...I don't know. It's hard to know what you're interested in. And I feel like - you have a semester, you have one or two classes where you say, "Well this sucks", or "I don't care about this"; and if those are fundamental courses, then it becomes, well, "What the hell am I doing here?" A lot of second guessing, I think, second guessing the path. 

It's hard, because you kinda just pick something and you're kind of stuck with it, right? If I take one dip into computer science, I can't pivot into - okay, well data science is very similar - but if I take one dip into computer science, I can't really pivot to electrical engineering comfortably and still accomplish my goals. I went into college already knowing this. So now I'm like - and even then I'm like, "Is this what I should have done?" And there are things now that interest me. Psychology is really interesting to me. I don't think I ever would've gone for a psychology degree, but if there's a future where in five, 10 years, I wanna take some courses, get some sort of something, who knows. But I feel much more comfortable now because I feel like there is a future that I can fill with those other things that I wanted to look into. I don't know how far I strayed off topic, but yeah.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

I was barely affected because I was already working remotely. The entire team was already remote, and if anything, it boosted our company because we worked directly with sports, and sports stopped. So then they became more accessible to talking.  

So I feel like I did not get impacted. I know of people who were impacted, either wrapping up school, having just wrapped up school and having to find a job in the pandemic, having a lot of things cut off from you...I'm glad I graduated early, because if I didn't, I would've been in the exact same boat where we're going through this huge transitional period, where you have your degree, you're dumped off into the world, and you're dumped off into a very closed-off time. And so I'm glad that I didn't have to experience that, but just the added stress of uncertainty, especially early on - 'cause that, that was when most of my friends were graduating or having just graduated, and having to navigate a new state and new circumstances is a mess. And yeah, there are a couple people that I've seen burnout on it. You need a very good support structure, for sure.  

**Okay. Close to wrapping up here: considering everything we've talked about today, do you or did you enjoy your academic work?**  

I ask myself that question a lot. I think if I concentrated less on my academic work, I would've had more success in my academic work. And I mean that in...if I cared about establishing a social life and making friends, having large connections that have nothing to do with the courses that I am taking or where I am physically living, had more to do with my interests, I think I would've enjoyed it a lot more. I think I would've had a better balance between the two. Having gone through it and not being able to change it, I'm gonna say I didn't enjoy the majority of it. All my enjoyable stuff was out of major! I loved my language courses. I liked talking with that one materials science professor. I liked all of this stuff that I felt like I could express in. Like the STEM stuff, EECS, chemistry, statistics - none of that felt expressive. In high school I very much enjoyed performing, and I feel like I lost a lot of the ability to do that based on what I went into. And I think it was much less enjoyable than it could have been.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Um, I don't think I would've been very aware of burnout. Didn't personally experience it in high school as far as I remember. Imposter syndrome started happening at the end of high school when I realized all of these connections are going to - like the vast majority of them are going to die, a lot of these connections and relationships that I built up. Then I came to the realization of, well, who am I really? 'cause I felt like I was so much the sum of these connections, that if those start disappearing and getting uprooted, then, well, dying was basically how I looked at it. S I don't know if that necessarily fits imposter syndrome, but I definitely started to feel out of place.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Don't leave [name removed] after the dorm party gets busted. There's one moment, exactly, where I was interested in having a social life. I was. I went to a dorm party with two friends from high school, and one of them, her roommate and some guy they met. My buddy's new friend was a little drunk and a little rude, and then the dorm party got broken up and - I did not drink until after I graduated, so I knew I was fine. But they were like, "Hey, you're at this party, drinking in the dorms is illegal" - 'cause it's a freshman dorm - and so they started carding us. They started doing the M-cards or whatever, "You'll have to attend this thing and you'll get written up" and I'm like, "I did nothing".  

I came out, I wanted to have a good time and be completely, explicitly legal in all of my things, because that was the mentality that I had and held through university. And that was just immediately snapped, and my resolve was immediately broken. They wanted to continue on to some other places, find something else, and I said "No". And I just walked away. I walked a quarter-mile to a bus stop and just took that and went home, went to bed. And I wish that I had stayed out and had a little bit more resolve and not let that set me back so much, because I think that very much put me on the path to burnout because I didn't have something non-work to do. Because I very hard-committed to "We are working, we are here, we are at this university to get shit done".  

In terms of imposter syndrome, I don't know. I don't think I would say anything, because I think that's a part of the growth. You have to be able to look around and ask, "Okay, what's everyone really doing and where are we all really at?" It's fine that everyone collectively has no idea, but I don't think I would tell myself anything in terms of imposter syndrome. Because I think that's something that just has to be learned.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

I think my - Hey, cat, get your arm out of the way!  

I think my experience at UofM was a very mild, very slow decline. Very mild. And then I didn't acknowledge that I was declining slightly, and I shot for the stars without having a good foundation. I took one of the hardest capstones and the hardest course at the university in the same semester. Double time sinks, absolute mess. I shot for the stars, 'cause I'm like, "I'm the guy, I'm gonna be the guy that can do this". And I was not the guy to do that. It just took that one decision and the result of that, and I very quickly stumbled down and thankfully was able to identify a lot of what was going on, um, and start pulling myself out of it.   

I'm still continuing, I feel, to pull myself out of it. I still am constantly wondering, am I spending my time wisely? Am I being disciplined? I have huge discipline difficulties now. I'm constantly second-guessing myself, and I'm constantly all over the place. I'm just now trying to find - like I've constantly been someone who creates calendars. I always create a schedule, but that schedule gets blown through in three days and completely ignored. And I think it's stemmed from this, where it got to the point where I decided, "Nothing that I do matters, so I'm just gonna sit back and let it ride". That was kind of the mentality that grew out of that sharp drop-off. 

I could identify the steps that got there, right? Like I said, lack of an active social life, very narrow focus over the course of a very long period of time, three years of trying to just do one thing. But I think it's...I mean, it's hard to see the warning signs when you're living through it. It's something that I've gotten a lot better at, and right after, I would always do a lot of introspection and I would always think a lot and like I said, I would develop the plan. I was very bad at the time and for some time after of *doing* the plan.  

That's all else I can think of.  

**Alright, in that case, thank you for your participation and I will stop the interview here.**
