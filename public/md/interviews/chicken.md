**Alright. Just to warm up a bit, tell me a little bit about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

I guess it was relatively standard. Went to elementary school locally, then the local middle school, then the local high school. I suppose it would be called somewhat privileged, given that my schools were relatively new and well funded and had good teachers for the most part. But it's pretty standard as far as organizational scheme goes. 

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I don't know. If I extend peers to be somewhere a little bit looser than acquaintances, I would say maybe 30 to 40 people that I might recognize. If you're talking about the number of people with the same current academic standing, as well as major considerations, then that number...I don't even know how I'd estimate, but I suppose it must be 50 or something. So yeah. I'm not quite sure what you mean by this question, but those would be rough estimates.  

**Peers is whatever you would consider to be a peer, so definition is up to you. So that was fine.**  

**Okay, how many years have you been in your major?**  

I guess I've sort of been following the major plan all three years. Technically I think I only enrolled sometime during my second year, so between one and two years. I don't honestly remember.  

**What's the story of you deciding on your major?**  

That's also a great question. I don't really know, I felt like around the end of high school, I decided, "Math is cool. Computer science is cool." So then I started taking math and computer science classes during college, and they were still both pretty cool. I just don't feel like I have a very compelling story to tell.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

<laugh> That's a good question.  

It would be around finals of my first semester of my third year. Pretty much everything lined up; I had a hard exam - well, I think multiple hard exams, I might be forgetting - that I had to study for, as well as a group project that had run into some very major issues. So then...I don't know, perhaps this is normal, where you just stay up and you just grind through things. You keep on messaging people on Slack to say "Hey, this part is wrong, we gotta fix this part", and ultimately I didn't end up studying too much for that one final exam. I'm not quite sure how much it would've helped either way, because the final exam was hard for me, but I guess it was most memorable because it was probably the most difficult academically speaking. Yeah.  

**What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in an average semester?**  

Um, that's a great question. I'm not quite sure I'd be able to answer you, because most of my work is rather eclectic. Well, if I had to estimate, that's probably...anywhere between 20 and 30 hours a week. I don't know if that's a very accurate estimate. Like I said, it's very eclectic for me to amortize the time spent. But yeah, around 20 hours probably. 30 on a bad week. Sounds about right.  

**What's your average number of rest hours in an average week?**  

I usually try to aim for at least seven hours of sleep, so that's 42 at least.  

**Okay, how about outside of sleep?**  

Yeah, I usually allocate around two hours to like, eat and digest per day. I dunno if this is considered rest or, um, living? <laugh>  

I did at some point survive on one meal a day for a number of weeks. That was fine, it was a very large meal. So that's a great question. I'd say I usually have at least one or two hours every day to not do stuff, even on bad weeks. But usually I'd say maybe three or four - I don't know. This is also very difficult for me to amortize, because like I said, work is eclectic. So rest is eclectic. I love using weird words too, as you might have noticed.  

**Just to make sure, does eclectic just mean random?**  

Yeah, yeah. Perhaps I'm using the word wrong...I've heard it used like this before, but I could just be using it wrong.  

**Um, [googling the term] "deriving ideas, styles, or tastes from a broad range of sources". That, uh...** 

That seems different from what I'm trying to say. I mean a more...old one?...  

**Eccentric?**

Maybe. 

**Eccentric is just weird though. That's not...Like it means weird. So that's...**  

Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know what I mean? You can correct that in the transcript and be like "this idiot used the wrong word".    

**Yeah, don't worry, I'll note that down. "This 'idiot' used the wrong word..."** *[For reasons of basic politeness, I will not actually refer to the interviewee in this way.]*   

Yeah. Eccentric. Um, yeah, I'm looking it up on Wiktionary and it says "unrelated and unspecialized", which I think is the meaning I'm trying to use here? An eclectic taste in food, an eclectic taste...Um, I don't know. I definitely heard this. Let me see if I can link it as well. Um, anyways, do you have more questions?

**I do have more questions, yes. <laugh>**  

**What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Oh, probably like 40 to 50. An exact count I wouldn't be able to tell if tried. Maybe 40 to 50 doesn't count as being a lot for some people; I guess for me, it's a lot.  

**What was your average number of rest hours for that semester per week?**  

For that semester, uh, it probably averages out to being like three to four hours a day as per normal. But during the busiest times, it would just be flat zero. It would eat into my sleep schedule too.  

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

Also something I probably couldn't tell you if I tried. But I'd say somewhere between 50 and 60, probably never more than that, because more than that is like 10 hours a day, and...yeah, I don't know.  

**Can you walk me through an example of that week?**  

Probably the most memorable experience where like, everything's just falling apart, so you just need to work, work, work. That's pretty much it. I don't know, I don't keep very good track of these things, so I find it difficult to pin down an exact number.  

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I think generally, unless something happens to accidentally go wrong - like that week was not the result of rescheduling or class workloads, it was just the result of bad luck. Really, it would be difficult to describe the exact circumstances, but it was just sort of bad luck. So I would say in general, I feel like I have pretty good control of my time except whenever I feel like I'm rushing to finish something. Which I can very easily attribute to myself just being lazy. So I don't know, perhaps I've been lucky in that regard.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?** 

Well during high school - perhaps it's a bit, um, what's the word...presumptuous, or prideful of me to say that high school work didn't feel extremely engaging or difficult most times. And perhaps that's a common sentiment at UofM, because of the whole "best and brightest" thing. You get a lot of really smart people here. But ultimately I found college work to be much more engaging. You were given a lot more freedom on what sort of work you wanted to pursue? I don't know if that's quite the right word to describe it, but there was less of a sense that it was just busywork. You're really trying to learn something. Perhaps that's due to the selection of classes I chose.  

I think I can attribute that in large part to some excellent math classes I took in my first and second semester. At the beginning, I got certainly more engaged in doing academic work, simply because the academic work was more engaging. Then of course you have COVID, so everything goes virtual. It was certainly less interesting when things were virtual. But yeah, interest sort of fell down then. I started picking up more, sort of research topics, so interest went up again, and that's about where I'm at right now. I'm not quite as engaged as I was my first semester, but certainly much more than during high school.  

**Mm-hmm. Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Also a great question. I'm not quite sure...I think part of it was just the whole pandemic and everything going virtual, so you're just like, "Okay, now I'm stuck at home doing assignments again". During then, my energy level enthusiasm probably dropped. Now it's back again, because we're back in person and part of more group oriented projects, which I sometimes like more than just homework assignments. Like it's fun working in a group. Sometimes it can be aggravating, and you'll definitely hear me say "I'd rather do this by myself", but usually I look back and say, "Oh, this was pretty fun". Yeah.  

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**   

In some ways, yeah, some ways, no. At least grade-wise, exactly what I would score on an exam or test has gone down, but that's also because I've been steadily picking up more difficult classes and more of these more difficult classes. So it's sort of expected. But yeah, if I was to say percentile-wise where I was in each class, that's more or less stayed the same. Maybe dropped down a bit because more rigorous classes will certainly have, well, more academically vigorous people that elect to take it. Those are the classes I'm interested in, these elective classes. And again, maybe that's presumptuous or, what's the word again? Egotistical, that's the word! If that's what you're asking.  

I don't know, this brain isn't working correctly today. Yeah, it's one of those words where someone's puffing themselves up to be more than they might really be. And I do feel like I am somewhat doing that when I speak here, so I dunno.  

**Okay, changing direction with the questions a little bit - when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

For long term goals that are generally very broad, I usually find they're relatively realistic. Because you just sort of work at it for long periods of times, and eventually it comes together - or at some point you decide that it isn't possible for it to come together. Just sort of, things where I push it off into the bin of things that I should have done, or it's a very short term goal. And I think I've been trying to get myself into the habit of just getting smaller goals directly out of the way, but then it's like the quote, "every plan fails on contact with the enemy". So like midterm goals that are supposed to be more concrete and like planned out usually tend to go awry because I didn't fully consider everything that would happen, or it's just very difficult to fall multiple of these steps. What I said is more of a general sentiment than something concrete.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Again, for fear of being overly pompous...I suppose I was at least especially strong...in the environment I was in. But even before UofM, I've taken classes where there are people who are far better than me at certain things. And it's normal. You're almost never the biggest. I dunno, suppose that's pretty normal.  

**Do you or have you felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Um, no, not really. I wouldn't say so usually. I try to set relatively reasonable expectations for myself. Perhaps I've just gone through that phase where it's like, "You should do your best and maybe you should try being superhuman, but even if you fail, then as long as you made a good effort at it" - I wouldn't be very dissatisfied usually with a good effort at something. Even if you don't succeed, it's still very commemorable.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

It's just a live and learn relationship with failure. Perhaps that's simply because I haven't failed enough, or perhaps *fatally* enough, with something really, really goes wrong. Going back to that example, that group project where we found out that we, uh, had sort of screwed up about a month's worth of data and had to fix it. That went really wrong, but in the end we were able to scrap everything together through too much work - I would say that was an unpleasant experience! But yeah, perhaps I just haven't failed hard enough. 

I certainly have failed - I've gotten grades that I would've rather not gotten in some classes. But at the end of the day, I feel that a lot of those are from not studying enough or maybe the grading of the class was actually sort of funky. So I'm usually never too caught up in grades, as they are, as I would say, um, mostly fake. So I don't really pay much attention to them these days.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

What would you count as academic praise?  

**Say if you do well in something and someone says, "Oh, you did really good". I mean, I think in particular when people say that you are good at what you do, or you are very skilled at this or something similar. If you've heard that before.**  

I don't know. Most of the people that I'm usually in contact with are at a similar-ish level of skill with most of the things we talk about. So for the most part, it's just like, yeah. We're both so and so at some academic thing, and it's like - I don't know. I feel like it doesn't usually come up in normal speech between me and the people I usually talk to. It'll be like, "I did really good on this test", and then at most, somebody would say, "Oh, good job". It's like, that was a really hard test, you did really good at it, but it's just a passing point in conversation. So I've never really thought about it.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Uh, if the success feels warranted - if you worked hard to do it - I usually feel pretty happy about that. And my head goes, "Hey, I should do this again in the future! *Serotonin good!*" But then sometimes the success feels...sort of given to you on a platter. And it's like, "Okay, sure, I did good, yeah, that's cool". It's more of a neutral, slightly miffed reaction because...I don't know, perhaps I've just stopped caring as much about these things. Success and defeat, success and failure, I suppose, are generally less interesting than what you did to get there. That's my view of things: I don't do absolutes at all.  

**OK. Just out of curiosity - when you say there's those two different reactions, one being positive and one being neutral, depending on how deserved it feels - what's the relative balance of how frequently one feeling or the other comes up?**  

That's also a great question that I don't quite think I'd be able to answer precisely. I guess usually it's a relatively neutral reaction, or it has been historically a relatively neutral reaction. But as I've been taking more difficult classes, doing well in a more difficult class certainly elicits a happier reaction. Of course that also comes with more failures, so yeah.  I don't know if people have played *Dark Souls* or other FromSoftware games, but in those games, sure you'll die against something a lot. But once you do succeed, then it really feels like it was just sort of that. It is just sort of that general sentiment, which I don't think is too unrelatable.  

**Okay. How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I suppose people I know will say "Oh, good job. That was nice." And then people, I don't know will be, “Oh, good job. That was nice”, but are apathetic about it. These sorts of academic successes and failures are things that I suppose I don't talk to my friends too much about these days. Yeah, I just don't quite know. I just don't really remember, I guess.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yep. Yep. Yeah.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

In a very technical sense, it's like you keep on doing something long enough that it starts to wear out your internal bearings. Maybe because you've been doing something for a very long time or you've been encountering a lot of failures at this for a long time. At some point, you just don't really want to do it. This is just sort of my personal definition, probably not a great universal definition.

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

This one I'm less certain I can succinctly put into words. It may be something like the idea where it feels like you're not qualified to do something, even though you keep on doing it. Perhaps this is for like, a job: you were hired, even though you weren't qualified and you're doing it. And you encounter successes, but you attribute those successes to luck rather than skills or effort...another attempt towards a universal definition. Difficult.  

**Okay. Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

I can say with high certainty that I think I have. Can I give you a specific example of this? Likely no, I have very bad memory.  

I'm certain I've had this before, but never on large enough of a scale for...well, not a "large", but a, a deep sense of burnout. I've never had a truly deep sense of burnout, I think. But I've certainly been burnt out of things a lot. Like I'll work on math for eight hours and get nowhere, and then it's just like, "Screw math, math is entirely fake", and then you just don't do math for a day. That's the sort of burnout I usually encounter. I encounter it more than I probably think, but also it never lasts too long. I've never had this sort of burnout where I say, "No more math. I'm not taking math classes next semester. That's enough."  

**Okay. Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Well, I am holding back the urge to make an *Among Us* joke here *[Editor's note: *Among Us* is a video game where players are divided into teams of "crewmates" and "imposters"]*...yeah, yeah, yeah, laugh all you want, it's stuck in my head, it lives rent free there now. *[Second editor's note: heh.]* But as for this, I don't quite know what it is like. I guess what I said previously about success and failures somewhat relates to this, but again, it's difficult for oneself to judge whether one's self-judgments are correct or accurate or not. Which I feel is what imposter syndrome sort of is? But I don't think it's wise to rely on externalized confirmation. So I think similarly to burnout, if I experienced imposter syndrome, I probably just put it off to the side and said "Okay, let's do better next time" or something.

I dunno, perhaps I just sound like a psychopath or something. I don't have a standard like, social conflict - you know how they have network conflicts in say, build configuration? - in my brain or something. I find it difficult to vocalize a lot of these things. I feel like I've never thought too much about these things, and I generally don't really discuss this sort of thing with my friends too often, so, um, yeah.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I would say it's also relatively high, but at least judging by what I've heard from my friends about their respective areas of study, I don't think it's been a sort of deep burnout. Or perhaps I'm mistaken - maybe they are really burnt out, but they're just slogging through things. Which would be unfortunate...but yeah.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

This is a good question. I guess looking back, probably a decent amount. A lot of times we'll just do a math problem or something else and say...At least for coding, sometimes I try something and I'll see "Oh, that worked first time, I guess I got lucky". I suppose you might put that under imposter syndrome or something similar, but I don't know. That's a difficult question for me to answer. Among my peers, it's likely not uncommon. You do a difficult problem and you say "I have no idea how I did that, but it worked out", at least for the subjects that I share most commonly with my peers. Which is things like math and computer science. 

For a lot of these things, if you can write down the solution for a problem, then you understand how the solution works and why it's the right solution, how you got there. It's simply proof that you must understand to be able to write it down. Well, that applies to a lot of situations, so...yeah. I don't quite know if that answers your question again. 

Like, a proof is proof that you understand.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

That's a very complex question to answer. I guess it's probably made me more aware of my own burnout and less aware of others', simply because for most of the pandemic I was just staying home. The only communication I had was through things like meeting up infrequently or talking online, so at least personally, if you have less time to see people in person, like - how a person talks online and in-person is slightly different.  

**Just a few more questions here. Considering everything that we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yes, I would say so. There are of course times when it can become frustrating and difficult to go on, but usually getting through those moments is very satisfying. So I would say yeah, I enjoy it.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Not very, I guess. I've heard those terms before coming into UofM. I guess those terms are more used by the computer science department than by the mathematics department though. I could be entirely be wrong about this also. I think the CS department is just much larger, so...I don't know. I would definitely say that my time at UofM has made me more aware of these words and concepts at least, and probably of their prevalence as well.

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I guess that's a good question. Um, just don't worry about it. It gets better - at least personally for myself. I don't think that's advice that is good in general, but at least like - I don't know, if I'm getting advice from the future, most of the stuff I would say would be stock market actions or something! So confirmation from my future that things would be okay is probably the strongest thing for me. Just like, "Keep going with it, at times it'll feel bad, but it does get better". I guess that's what I would say? Again, maybe that sounds egotistical and prideful? but I dunno. Confirmation from your future self...yeah.  

**Is there anything else that you'd like to say?**  

Um, not really. I think I've said my fill of this. Let me think...Yeah, nope. Nothing comes to mind.

**Okay. In that case, that is a wrap. So I'll stop recording.**
