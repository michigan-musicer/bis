**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

What do you wanna know? It's a big question. <laugh>

**Yeah, it's open ended. Whatever you think is relevant.**  

Uh, let's see. I guess probably the most relevant thing is background in the topics that I'm studying and I've studied now. I come from a high school that has access to many leading STEM programs that exist throughout the nation. So I had access to lots of higher level courses, AP courses, post AP courses - so college level courses. Like in high school, I took multivariable calculus and linear algebra, and I actually took classes at a university on topology. So I have a fair amount of background from my high school education. Coming to UofM, I had a few years of programming experience - I had started programming right before the beginning of high school. So I would say those are probably the most relevant things from my pre-college experience. 

**Separately for both undergrad and grad, approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

That's a hard one. You can say friends, you can say classmates, but peers is more ambiguous. Right? I'm gonna count peers as classmates that I'm acquainted with, so I'm comfortable discussing concepts and topics with, for example. And grad school is definitely far fewer. Most of my peers in that sense are PhD students, a few master students, uh, I'd say roughly - this is a total ballpark estimate - 50 people. Then in undergrad I'd say closer to like a 150 people.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your major, for both undergrad and grad?**  

4.5 by now. Yeah.  

**That would be 3.5 undergrad and 1 in grad?** 

Yeah.

**Okay. What is the story of you deciding on your major? Tell me the story of you deciding on it for undergrad and also for continuing on to grad school.**  

I mean, for undergrad, at that point it was kind of a given that I would do something programming-related because I really, really enjoyed it. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to work on in high school. Well, I always had some kind of interest in something that had both software and hardware, <laugh> but at the time I just said "I'll do CS". I hadn't really thought about it in more detail then.  

So as a grad student, it was a little bit more intentional. I told myself, "Okay, the space of problems that are really interesting to me is really, really small. And in terms of the most interesting problems, they are these kinds of problems, because this is very underdeveloped as of now - and so this is a no-brainer decision for me." It was exactly what I wanted to do at the time; I had already started doing some relevant stuff, but I really honed in on this topic after junior year of college. But yeah, the choice for undergrad was just based on an implicit understanding of what I wanted to do, and then for grad school, it was because I learned something in undergrad that made me really, really interested in this topic and want to pursue it further.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM? Either undergrad or grad?**  

Uh, this is a hard one. Okay, obviously I have like so many...honestly I'm just saying I enjoyed grad school far more than I enjoyed undergrad, so I have a lot of recency bias here. I've definitely enjoyed what I've done now, but in undergrad, let's seeâ€¦

**You can always just pick one and go with it rather than trying to figure out what the most memorable one was.**  

Right, right, right. I'm just trying to think of *any* memorable ones. Okay. I mean there's a lot of small events here and there, but anything in particular...Oh! I would say definitely my operating systems class that I took with Baris. I took that a few years ago. That was a really good class. I'd say...at least when I took that class, that's when I realized what computer science was more about. It wasn't really about, well, I mean - you kind of understand what computer science is about - but I was dealing with these hard problems, and I was trying to solve these hard problems and spending a lot of time trying to solve these hard problems. Before that, most of my projects would take a few hours to a day at max.  

All those classes before, it was "whatever" and I would postpone them. But for OS, you have to put in that time. You have that expectation, and you learn so much. Even if you don't do that well in the class, you still learn so much and you gain a really important skill. In terms of specifically memorable, I'd say, at least for me, a lot of experiences with Piazza. I was very active, and a lot of the people in the class would make memes about me or whatever. <laugh> It was kind of funny. In any case, I'd say that class was very memorable because the culture was also really, really good. And it was a nice little tight-knit community, which is not something I saw at all before then.

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester, for both undergrad and grad?**

The difference is quite staggering. In grad school, I spend nearly 80 to 100 hours a week working. In undergrad, I spent closer to 40. 

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester for that split? Like time you take to rest during the day.**  

In undergrad...sorry, I'm trying to calculate. I'd say for just working days, uh...I don't know, you have like 40 hours of work, then - I slept a lot in undergrad. I'd say I slept close to 9 hours a day in undergrad. So I don't know, let's say 20 hours of waking rest hours per week, something like that. Does that math add up? I don't think it adds up, but something like that. And in grad school it's much lower, but still I'd say maybe 10. Yeah, that math is totally wrong. I'm too lazy to calculate it off the top of my head. 

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was? For both undergrad and grad.**  

For both undergrad and grad...okay. I'd say in grad school easily, like - sorry, can you repeat the question? Right, I'd say 80 for my first semester in grad school, but that's because I took four courses, was a GSI, and had research on the side. In undergrad I'd say it's probably my first semester sophomore year. I was taking the core courses for the CS curriculum, like 281 and 370, and I had four other courses on top of that. I'd say at that point, probably closer to like 60 to 70.  

**And for those semesters, what was the average number of waking rest hours you got per week?**  

I'd say 10 for both. I don't know exactly, but let's say 10.  

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

Well, an actual "most number of hours I've worked in a single week"...I would say working all day for seven days of the week, closer towards the end of a semester. I'm gonna say 100 is the peak.

**Can you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Sure. I barely remember the old ones, but let's think about the week from this past semester - which was less busy as a semester, but that last week had so much stuff that I actually ended up submitting stuff after the semester ended. At that point I had a big submission for a research project due the day the semester ended, and I also had two full conference-length paper reports due the last day of the semester. So I had essentially three different big projects due the last day of the semester. 

What ended up happening was I spent pretty much the whole week writing the paper, pretty much on my own, for one of the classes. So Sunday to Saturday, I'm writing the paper the entire time and doing coding experiments and stuff like that. And then the week after, there were three projects (like I told you). And in between, when I was a bit fatigued from writing, then I would go back to that other project, which was with a bigger group. It wasn't led by me, so I didn't have as big of a responsibility, but I did have to contribute some code on that front as well 'cause we were trying to get something deployed. 

And then for the third thing that I had, at that point I had already written a lot of code during the semester. I just hadn't written the report. I ended up writing the report the week after because uh, the professor was flexible. He said "Okay, I'll give you that time". That's what I can remember. But that differs wildly from what my undergrad experience might be like, because I didn't have any exams that week. I didn't have any exams at all. It was all big research-type work. In undergrad it would just be like, "Oh, you have this final project. You have to write a lot of code within a short amount of time, get all your tests working, pass autograder," whatever. Then you maybe have a final report as well, but you're working on that more with the group, so it's fine. Then an exam probably. I don't know, I barely remember that part; but I know it wasn't as hectic as the one that I just described earlier. 

**For both undergrad and grad, how much control do you feel you had over how you spent your time?**

I mean, control in what sense? Because if you're taking a course, right? - if you consider a course to be a waste of time, then you don't have control over your time; but you know, you signed up for that course, so you kind of knew what you were getting yourself into. So you have control over your time in that sense, because you committed to that. I guess in terms of time that I feel like I wasn't doing exactly what I wanted to be doing - okay, I'm going to interpret control that way. 

So I was a TA for a few semesters, and I would say some of the time I spent doing TA work I didn't have control over, even though I committed to it and I knew what I was getting myself into. It was interesting, but sometimes you'd have to do a lot of menial work, set up more resources for students than you thought you would have to originally. You would have to lose time contributing to other things that you wanted to work on in the meantime. So in those senses, I would say that's where I lost control of my time. In another sense - and I think this is me personally - I've considered some courses to be a waste of time. And so any work I did for those courses would be losing control of my time in that sense. Even in the most drastic example, the one I was talking about with writing report during the last week of the semester - I didn't wanna write that report, which is why I ended up postponing it so far and having to spend like all my time during that one week writing that report. 

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah. There are two big points: one was that exams are a huge waste of time. I used to think exams were fine; even when I did poorly, I figured "Yeah, I know it's necessary. It's super important." That's what I used to think. The second big change of attitude was that courses themselves are a waste of time. <laugh>   

Um, let me think. The first change of attitude happened in the OS class. I did not think the OS class should have had exams. More and more, I felt like studying for exams is a waste - primarily because I'm forgetting this stuff later, and I'm not retaining it. So I feel like studying for exams is a huge waste of time. It does not do a service to students.  

And this is why grad school's so much better, because professors know like exams are a massive waste of time, and they have a lot more leniency about like what kind of grade distributions they assign. And so they're like, yeah, I'm not gonna give you an exam for this course. Like there's no point - professors don't care if everyone gets a hundred or all As in the course. The important part is that you do the work, you understand the work, you get something out of it, and that you can use that skill later. A lot of the undergrad courses, they don't care. Well they implicitly care and they want to care, but when you have these stupid, um, other requirements in the course, then you are essentially signaling "I care, but I don't have control over it because of what the department is telling me to do".  

Which is fine. But that's just a personal gripe with exam culture in college. Especially in CS where you're not really evaluated on your grades; you're evaluated on your skills and your ability to build things and solve engineering problems. More so than your ability to write code on an exam. There's like a difference for me from exams in the first few general courses in undergrad, like exams in math versus CS exams and also high school versus college. High school, you need some way to evaluate yourself - and I still have a gripe with that exam culture as well. 'cause it's super compressed and I kind of get mad that I've forgotten a lot of stuff from high school that would actually be very useful knowledge nowadays, like now that I think about it more - but, um, yeah, so exams I think after that I just thought, "This is such a bother".  

And the second one was...oh, I said courses themselves. But I don't know. I don't know if that's a great discussion to have, but...I feel like in grad school, I wanted to spend more and more of my time on research and on doing novel and interesting things. And I am very happy to. I've done this several times now, just spend weeks grinding through research papers or textbooks or whatever, to learn a thing on my own and use it - rather than go through a course that's moving somewhat slowly with sparse assignments, and then having to worry about these grades and do a thing I don't care about for some requirement or a grade. That's when I started thinking courses are more and more of a waste of time.  

The prevailing attitude in grad school is this attitude. I think every PhD student I've spoken to, they all say "Yeah, I'm trying to get all my courses out of the way as soon as possible. I wanna spend my time doing research cause that's what I'm here for." Even if you're not interested in research, even if you're interested in more product-side problems or other problems, it's like, yeah, courses are not it.

**Did you have a change in your overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

That's a good question. I'd say my energy was very low for the first few years of college. I was very interested in what I was doing and I liked my courses, but at the same time, I was not really sure. I think because I've always had this implicit interest in what Iâ€™m doing now. At that time, I was not getting what I wanted out of it. Actually, when I came to college, I wanted to join some kind of relevant organization, but there was none explicitly doing that. I tried to join this one student org, but it also was not the best thing for me. Uh, crap. I'm forgetting the original question again. Can you repeat that? <laugh> 

Sorry. So the reason I talk about that is because...like, energy level to me is how interested and devoted I am to a certain thing, how much I wanna do it outside of class. How much I wanna spend my free time in the weekends and stuff like that. For coursework, I would say, especially in the beginning of college, I didn't really care about it enough. Towards the end of undergrad, I was focusing on more specialized things, and with these more specialized courses, I spent more and more time and I was much more happy with that. And I had much more energy to do these things, to really dive into ecosystems and stuff like that.  

And in grad school, like I was telling you, my peak is a hundred hours a week. I have a lot of energy now to do these things, and I want to do them. In undergrad, like I told you, there was a semester where I took six different credited courses. And you could say "Maybe he has a lot of energy" or "He's too ambitious" or something. I didn't do very well that semester because I kind of burned out like right in the middle of it. I thought to myself, "Okay, this is getting a lot. It's like really, really a lot." And I just couldn't keep up. I tried to keep up the best as I could, but my grades were not too pretty that semester either. <laugh>  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah - so the worst semester for me was that six course semester where I told you I got really, really burnt out. And I lost a lot of confidence after that semester. 

It really hit me hard 'cause I took OSthe next semester. But I lost so much confidence from that semester. Academic performance-wise, after that it was kind of a low point. I took some time and struggled to recover a bit by the end of undergrad. In the end, my grades were very good again. And in grad school, my grades are very good also, but I think at that point I had loaded myself way too much, and it definitely shows on my transcript and it showed in my involvements and my overall energy and attitude.  

**When you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

So the question depends on which timeframe we're looking at.  

**Sure. We can talk about both undergrad and graduate.**

How realistic...my goals are almost never realistic, but I would say - so in undergrad I would say I was very inconsistent at accomplishing goals, especially when I had spread myself too thin. But I was just naturally interested in all these things. I didn't want to give up on them. So it was really hard to accomplish goals, even though I had them. 

In grad school, I've done a lot better at it, but you realize with the nature of the things you're trying to do, like the harder they get, the harder it is to accomplish those goals in a quick amount of time. So I generally lean very optimistic as to what I can do, and that's just general nature for me, I have always done that. But I think I've gotten better at accomplishing my goals and producing results since I started grad school.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yes I was, yes. I was usually one of the best students. Um, like, uh, yeah, I don't really like bragging about these things, but in high school I had one of the highest GPAs in the school. My test scores were usually very, very high, all that kind of stuff. That's usually how it went.  

**Do you, or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**

Pressure to be superhuman? Um, that's an interesting question. Undergrad, no, I never had that pressure. In grad school? Yeah. But it's an interesting question, because I like being pressured to be superhuman. It feels like I'm getting stuff done. <laugh>   

**Could you elaborate more on how you weren't pressured in undergrad and how you were pressured in grad school?** 

In undergrad, when you're caught up in all this coursework and you haven't already thought about like bigger picture things and issues you want to tackle, and you know, maybe you're focused on getting a job or something, you're not even looking at the future at all. Right? You don't really think about what's next or what kind of things do I wanna accomplish long term? So the pressure to be superhuman isn't really there. It's more "Okay, I'm gonna do what I have to do now based on what I've signed up for", et cetera. Even in that six course semester, right? I didn't feel any kind of pressure there. I told myself "I just have to do all my courses". I don't know, thinking about it from my perspective now...I'm not impressed with myself from back then, you know what I'm saying? So I would not call myself superhuman in any sense back then, but even if I was, I don't think I was pressured to be superhuman either because I was only really trying to do well in my courses. I guess this was the first two years of undergrad. 

After that - so I think this is a very important thing, and maybe you wanna touch on this later. But after graduating I took a gap semester of sorts. I was graduating at 3.5 years, and so I had that one semester where I was not really working. I had research projects ongoing, but I wasn't as pressured to, you know, do much. At that point, you get space and time to think, right? You're not busy with internships, you're not busy with coursework - and I got a lot of time to think about "What kind of things do I wanna accomplish?" So in that sense, that's when I felt "Okay, there are all these things that I didn't do in undergrad and that I really want to be able to do". These are not just technical skills like in CS. I'm talking about things like learning languages and reading more books and working out more, maybe reaching a certain goal for how many minutes can you run a mile. That kind of thing.  

At that point you're realizing "Okay, I have to manage all these other aspects of my life". And that's what I would call superhuman, in a sense that you wanna be really, really good at all these things, not just somewhat good at what you're doing in school, maybe get a good job or whatever. So I would say that's when I felt the pressure to be superhuman, when I wanted to do more things that were outside of my comfort zone. 'cause I was very much in my comfort zone in college. Even if I was doing a lot, I was still very much in my comfort zone. So I consider "superhuman" leaving that zone.   

**Okay. What is your relationship with failure?** 

Ooh, it's an interesting question. So my relationship now is I welcome and actively seek failure. I realized that that is a signal of progress, as long as you're seeking the right failures of course. Back then, I'd say in undergrad I was very bad at handling failure. I told you that one semester where I lost my confidence, with those like six courses and my grades dipped and all that stuff? I considered that a low point and I didn't handle that failure very well, because as I said, it took me a while to get that confidence back. Now if I fail, I still have my confidence, which is why I think I've gotten better at managing failure.  

I'm not perfect yet. I don't think I'll ever be perfect at it. It's hard to manage failure, but being able to know when you're failing and being able to take it in stride is very important. Actually, one of the bigger failures that I didn't recover from very well was college admissions. I think this is important for my background. For me personally...I told you I was like one of the top students in my school. And I went to one of the, um, a renowned school, like one of the better schools in the country. We feed lots and lots of like very highly ranked schools. UofM is actually a big beneficiary from my school.  

But also a lot of other schools, like the typical ivies, MIT, Stanford, all of those. We have a lot of students who go there often. And so I would say my environment in high school is way more competitive than my environment in college, which is very interesting. I had a lot of expectations for myself, and a lot of people around me had expectations for me; and I'd say in terms of like my college results, compared to the other students around me, and based on what teachers and guidance counselors had been telling me, I kind of underperformed on that front compared to everyone else. UofM is by no means a bad school, and it took me a while to realize just how good UofM is and what I'm offered here, and the opportunities I have here that I wouldn't have at other schools. The attitudes that I have here, I would not have developed from other schools.  

So that was the big failure. It took me a while to recover from. In my first two years - my first year, really - I was kind of in denial the whole time. I would say it hit me really, really hard. And I, I was like, "I don't wanna be here". Like, I enjoyed what I was doing, like my courses, but I was like, I was trying to like...I don't know what it was. I was kind of taking it in stride; I wasn't really thinking much at that point. I just thought, "I don't really know what I'm doing right now". And I hadn't really considered what I wanted in the future.  

So that was my pretty big failure. I think over time, you just kind of...you realize "Maybe I was being dumb, putting so much stress on like this one thing". And then, even if you underperform, now I say, "Okay, I still did pretty well". But I'd say that was one of the bigger failures that I've had to grapple with, because it hit my esteem a bit. I noticed it recur as a theme throughout undergrad. It's not at all there in grad school; I'm way more content with what I've been doing. 

**How do you react to academic praise from others?** 

Academic praise...so nowadays I don't care about academic praise. It's cool if I receive it, but it's not a big deal. I'm much more in tune with - I think one of the things with expectations and failure, right - you get in tune with what you're capable of, and you're more realistic with yourself. So even if you have these major, super ambitious goals, you have an understanding of where you are right now and what you need to do to push yourself to get to those super ambitious goals. In the past, when you're more in denial, you're not grounded. And so you think you can do these things when you haven't solved an underlying problem with yourself.  

Um, right. Whether you're denying these things or you're not working hard enough, or your confidence just isn't high enough, whatever it is. Uh, crap. Crap. I forgot your question. What was your question again? Oh, right, academic praise. So in that sense, the reason I mentioned all these things is...academic praise used to mean something to me, and now it doesn't. I used to take validation from academic praise. Like, "Oh yeah, I'm doing really well. I'm glad people are recognizing it." But now I have goals that go way beyond whatever these academic courses are and what academic praise is giving me. So it becomes more like "Yeah, cool, thanks". It's a nice little signal, but I'm not gonna take it too seriously because I know this is a point where I am my own feedback system and I am my harshest critic.  

Praise for myself is what I really look for. Let's see...I got a lot of praise, right? Especially in high school - I told you I was one of the top students. I consistently did very well at what I did, and so I liked it. You use it as a feedback mechanism. But for that failure that I talked about, academic praise is a great way to be ungrounded with yourself. Because when you're receiving this external signal, you think you're doing really well, but then you're not seeing what your errors are and you're not taking the feedback. You're looking for the praise, but you're not looking for the failure. You're not looking for the feedback.

So you're not looking to grow, which is the important part here. So at that time, there were a lot of things that maybe I'd done wrong before. And a lot of things I did wrong in undergrad, during those first two years when I was still kind of in that mindset. But then after that, as I said, I'm looking for failures. Now I'm looking to see how I can grow, where I'm going wrong, 'cause ultimately you wanna be better. That's my mindset on academic praise; it doesn't matter much.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

What feelings do I have when I succeed? Success is a weird thing, because you always know there's more. <laugh> Um, it's kind of greedy in that sense. There's the sense of relief that you've achieved some milestone to get somewhere that you want to get to. But along the process, you always come up with something you wanna do further than this goal that you had maybe a year ago. So success is, for me, a relief that I was able to do it, some short-term level of happiness. But it is very hard for me to celebrate successes as they're meant to be celebrated.

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

That's a good question; I'm not really sure. When you succeed, you're kind of like...I guess I'm kind of like focused on what's next. But others' reaction...I don't know. I think the thing with others is that they're going through the same problems as you, right? They're going through the same types of processes. Even if they're working on different things, when you're in a high performing environment, everyone wants to succeed and everyone supports each other's success. So what I've received - on the outside, at least - is support. Every time I've done something I would call a success, I'd received support and I've received good feedback. You can tell in the way people talk to you, and you can tell in the way people talk about your work. They take you a little bit more seriously, or they have cool ideas and maybe they wanna support you on something.  

In that sense, I say other people's reactions to success is like, you kind of imagine that they they're working towards their goals, and so they want the same level of success if not greater. I'm happy to support them as well. Usually my environment is very high performing, so I don't expect things like, you know, maybe in like earlier on in your life. Where when you succeed, you're more of a sparse signal among your environment, so you might receive things like awe and jealousy or something like that. It has happened before, but that's not something you expect when you're in like an environment like this one. So I don't really give too much thought to what others are thinking, but I know it is nice to hear someone I respect saying "This is really cool".  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?** 

Yeah. 

**How would you define burnout in your own words?** 

Yeah. So before I had experienced what I would call burnout, I thought it was like an excuse. With my experience with burnout or what I would've called burnout, it's that you're not doing what you want to do...um, right. That is a single thing. There are two things, I think, at least for me. Okay, I'm not gonna say "you", I'm gonna say "I". I am not doing what I want to do, and I am not strong enough to do what I want to do. That is how I felt about burnout. So there is a process of...so, okay. My personal opinion about my burnout, right? It's when I don't feel strong enough to do what I'm doing. And I think that's an energy thing and a confidence thing as much as it is like, maybe I'm not smart enough or sound enough in my skill or whatever...

You know, I'm gonna revise that definition. I think it's confidence and agency. So doing what I want to do and being confident in what I'm doing. I would call a lack of both of those things burnout. Okay. It took me a bit of time to think about what I was really feeling when I was burned out, and what I was really feeling was "I'm not enjoying it" and "I'm not confident in it", constantly insecure about whether I'm getting this right, and constantly doubting myself. And just not looking forward to working on it - when you're burned out, you don't look forward to doing this thing. It's like, "Okay, I have to do it". That happens a lot with just regular courses and stuff, like a lot of the time you have deadlines for homework or something. Like, "I don't wanna do this. I'm just gonna like bang it out in the last day or something." But there's a difference when it's like a prolonged thing, where you really don't want to do it, and you do as much as you can to delay it. The important part is you're okay with lowering -  

Sorry, I have to say "I". *I*'m okay with lowering my standards. That's when *I* would say *I*'m burned out, when I'm okay with lowering my standards because I just don't wanna put myself through it. I'm not sure. That's probably not consistent with most people's definitions of burnout, but maybe it is. I know burnout, definitely. Most of the time, a single thing I've noticed with other people who have told me they were also burned out is, well, they're not doing what they want to be doing. 

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?** 

Yeah. 

**How would you define that in your own words?** 

Hmm. Yeah, imposter syndrome is "I don't think I'm good enough to do this thing that I'm doing or currently working on". As a TA, I've had to deal with helping students manage imposter syndrome, and it's often like, uh...when I've experienced imposter syndrome - and I've experienced it multiple times - uh, let me think. I think the biggest times I experienced it are when I'm around a lot of really smart people doing something that I know almost nothing about. That's when I really feel like I experienced imposter syndrome, where I tell myself "I have no idea what's going on here".  

But there are times when you can experience vague imposter syndrome, where I feel like I'm just not as good as the other people around me, even though I'm pretty confident in what I'm doing. I think one great example is the OS class I was talking about earlier, where I was, you know, I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed what I was doing. I liked the work, I liked the project, I liked the concepts. But I felt like I was a bit slower than some of my friends at it. Famously, one of my friends who ended up becoming a TA for that course, he finished a project that took my group three weeks to finish - he did the whole thing on his own in two days, for one of the biggest projects. And if you've taken the OS class, you know that's kind of an impressive feat. And so it doesn't help to have ridiculously talented friends, but imposter syndrome manifests in that matter where you're like, "Okay, I'm not capable of these crazy feats". <laugh>  

**You've kind of touched this already, but do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah. Yeah, I do.  

**I know you talked a bit about the six course semester that you had. Do you want elaborate on that experience or other experiences that you'd like to discuss?**  

Other experiences? I'd say...I think the single thing that changed as - I wanna emphasize this - the single thing that changed my experience from this low confidence, "I've overworked myself", "I'm kind of burned out" state, is doing something that was really interesting to me. And not giving that up as a standard. I think that was the single thing that changed it for me. But you know, it gave me my confidence back, and I felt like, "Okay. I know what I'm doing, what I really want to do." And that's when you stop being burned out, when you're really interested in something, regardless if it's work or something else. When you're interested in something, you're not burned out. At least for that thing. 

**And you've already answered this question: do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?** 

Yeah.

**Are there experiences that you want to elaborate on there?**

No, I don't think so. <laugh>  

**Okay. How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

That's a hard one. We don't talk about it much. The whole premise of this study is great because, yeah, you're right. A lot of people don't feel comfortable talking about it. And I think just as much as students who, you know, feel like they may not be performing well feel burnout and imposter syndrome, I think there's an implicit thing among high performing students as well. And it's not talked about enough because, you know, they're high performing, why do we care about their experience, right? They'll do well, they'll succeed. That kind of thing. But I think that it's also just as important to manage. I mean, if you had to devote a finite number of resources and we assume it's a zero sum game, then of course devote those resources towards the students who need the help the most.  

But if you don't have those assumptions, then you assume they're both relevant. Anyway, the point is my peers don't talk about it much. You'll hear stories about like, like one of my friends has once told me - this is a friend from a different university, actually, not from Michigan - but the experience is very much similar. This guy was doing really well in his courses, and he was doing cool research. He was building this really impressive thing. And then he suddenly dropped out and didn't go to school, and he just stopped altogether. Upon talking with him, he didn't seem to have any serious, extraneous life experiences. So my assumption is that guy may have been burned out. Even though it seemed like he was doing really cool work and very high performing, maybe he still wasn't enjoying it.  


With high performers, especially, maybe it is a symptom of our expectations for ourselves, or just being unrealistic about what we can do. But I imagine that happens to everybody. I can't tell you too much about how my peers have experienced burnout. I imagine they have, but I don't know what they haven't told me about it. The best thing you can do is see what your friends are really doing right now. Are they taking a chill? And is there a reason for that? Is there not a reason? I think one thing, because we don't like talking about - I think we all implicitly understand that everyone has that experience, yet we never talk about it. So when someone says "I'm taking a break", no one asks why, because we all know; we're all going through that. Maybe we've all taken the break, or we all want that break really badly. So I think like the premise of the study is very good in that sense. 

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers? Similar answer?**  

I think burnout and imposter syndrome have an interesting like, you know, "how do these two things play with each other?". I would say for everyone who's experienced burnout, they've probably experienced imposter syndrome. And I would say with people, especially at like UofM, right? And in engineering school? I think everybody experiences imposter syndrome to some degree, because at some point they have to say "I have not done this thing, this really cool thing that this other person is doing". Even if it's not in college, like you're looking at people outside of college, maybe a friend from another school or someone in industry or someone your age, like some 19-year-old who started a company or something like that. So I think everybody experiences it. If we're talking about the academic environment and if the cause of the imposter syndrome is the academic environment, I would say there is still an implicit thing, where most people experience that.   

**How do you believe the COVID 19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout imposter syndrome?**  

Oh, it's interesting. I would say...so one thing. Yeah, I think that's a good question because that's kind of multifaceted. I think one of the important things in college is social lives, socializing to some degree. For many people, not everybody, but for many people - and that includes me. So when I was leading a student organization during the pandemic, because there were no in-person activities or anything, you kind of feel that everyone is not very interested in everything. My awareness of this - the collective, seeming lack of interest in both school and in these other activities - kind of gave me an idea of what burnout looks like. Because it seems like nobody's interested, right? For that organization, I'm sure that's partially a fault of the way we ran things. 

But I think the general environment, even in my classes as a TA during the first semester that COVID hit, where we were half in person and then the second half was remote. Even then, there's a drastic change in attitude, in the way we're doing things. It was immediately clear when a student or a group of students was struggling. Struggling to just have that motivation to work on something really cool. That course that I was TAing was project based. Students propose cool projects to work on, and at the end of the semester, many of the results weren't as cool as you thought they would be. I mean, this is a natural thing in most project-based courses; your expectations are usually higher than what you get out of it. But when you're not able to work with other people, you instantly lose out on half the reason you go to college, right? Half the reason is you have the social circle, you have like osmosis of knowledge and whatever, uh, <laugh>, whatever other abstract properties there are to socializing. It feels like an obvious answer, and I feel like a lot of people have talked about that kind of thing. But that's what I would emphasize too, the social aspect. 


**Okay, just a few questions left. Considering everything that we've talked about today, do you and did you enjoy your academic work?**  

I do enjoy my academic work. Did I enjoy my academic work in undergrad?...Yes. If you're not doing something you're interested in, that burnout or imposter syndrome experience is going to be tenfold, right? As I said, I knew I was interested in CS coming in, and so I knew I would enjoy what I was gonna do regardless. It was interesting to me - I wanted to know how to solve these engineering problems, I wanted to know all about computer science. I cannot imagine being someone who isn't interested in these things halfway through college, I imagine it's a much harder experience to get through. And I have a lot of respect for people who can at least gain the interest as they go along. That's a really strong property to have as a student. You can't only credit the university with piquing your interest in a topic; you have to credit the student as well, who's able to fight through the initial disinterest. 

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Not at all. Let me think...I believe not at all. I don't think I ever could have said I've experienced burnout or imposter syndrome. I do think I had experienced not burnout, but imposter syndrome before college many times; but I do not think that I was ever - like, I knew what the things were. People had talked about it in high school too. Especially in my high school, which was very into overworking and very competitive. A lot of people did not enjoy their experience there. I enjoyed it...but in any case, I knew that it existed. I did not ever consider what it felt like. 

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**

The reason it's so hard for me to answer this question is I'm not sure I would ever listen to myself. Like how would I try to tell this freshman "It's gonna be a long experience and you better be ready for it"? <laugh> Burnout is...I think like my natural reaction to that is I would try to prevent the burnout. Not explain to them what burnout is. But I think it's important to understand, right? But the only way you really understand it is by going through it, that's the key thing here. So I would say for me right now, it's like a key developmental experience because it develops both empathy and resiliency,, and anti fragility in a sense. I dunno.  

To me, it feels like you have to go through it. <laugh> It's just, can you recover from it? That's the question. That's the hard question. So what I would tell myself is...maybe I'll try to explain what that feels like. I mean, maybe the past me would listen to the future me, but I feel like the past me, if the future me was telling me like "You're gonna go through all these failures", past me would just be scared. I would maybe lose confidence instantly or something, And I would be stubborn and try to prevent that. And then I'd probably end up going through burnout anyway, because I'm not solving the right problem. So I would just try to explain what it's like.  

I'd try to explain what I've gone through, but uh, it's not something you can...well, for some people you can prevent it. right? And you have to prevent it in the right way. I think in the way that I had it, I overworked myself a ton, but if we wanna prevent a culture of burnout, it's a total different story. Sorry - when I initially was thinking about my answer to this question, I was thinking about what I would tell myself. And when I think about the type of culture that you want at a school, you don't want a culture where people are always like, "You have to go through burnout. It's like a natural experience in life." Sure, but you also want it to be in a way that people can recover, as I said. So I'm not sure how I would tell myself to recover or help myself recover from that. As someone who is successful in recovering- which is weird, because I'm sure I will go through burnout again at some point in my life. That's a normal thing for me. But to be able to recover is the hard question. <laugh> I don't know. Yeah.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

So - sorry, I know what the purpose of the interview is, but what is it going to be used for? Who's seeing it, and who's meant to see it?  

**Sure. This is going to be a public website, and edited transcripts of the interviews will be posted for people to see. If you're talking about the intended audience...I mean, I'm not sure how I'm going to publicize the interviews, because I want to be anonymous as well if I can. So honestly probably the UofM subreddit, maybe some other like relevant subreddits, and then like I'll probably invite interviewees to informally share among people that they know.  So students is really the target audience, yeah.**  

Okay. That's what I'm looking for. Yeah, that one's a hard one. 

**I'll probably send it to some professors as well. I don't know how interested they'd be in it, but...**

I think professors are the people who have the power to do things, if there is anything they can do. The problem is I imagine most professors think more like me, in the sense that sometimes it is inevitable...but that should not prevent them from figuring out how to give the best recovery, right? But for the students though, right? 

Take time. I guess that's what I would say. Taking that time to think is very important. I don't know, this is something I've actually experienced with a bunch of my friends. I have friends at like schools all over the country, from other top schools like Stanford or Chicago, or like, Yale or whatever. I think most people say when they have that gap semester, it's extremely important for them. So it's an interesting point, right? A gap semester is not something you usually think about. It's something that's more and more - especially in the CS curriculum - it's something you can totally do, because most people finish a year or half a semester early. [Based on statistics from Atlas for both the computer science BS and computer science BSE degrees, this is untrue - only about 25.1% of students finish their degree faster than 8 semesters.] 

So that gap semester is important. But if you're doing an internship during your gap semester, do you have that time to think? Not really. So idle time is important. I think you don't have to do a specific gap semester, but find some idle time. Significant idle time. Yeah.  

**If that's that, then I'll end the recording.**
