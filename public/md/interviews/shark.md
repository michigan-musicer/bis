**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Yeah. So I'm originally from the Bay Area, California, so a lot of my childhood has been about tech and that type of stuff. I mean, Bay is like the tech hub, right? And my parents are software engineers, so that also played into having a lot of tech education growing up. Specifically education-wise, I went to a private school from K through 8th, and then after that I went to a public high school in the Bay Area. It was like a pretty competitive high school, I would say. I think it was very Asian, which is pretty...I mean, it was easy to fit in and that type of stuff. So yeah, I went to a public high school, pretty competitive academically, challenging. Then after that, I went to UofM.

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Okay, that's an interesting question. I think for me, I see peers as a term where it's like, people you study with, people you see at class every day. So my answer's probably gonna be a lot lower than other people. I'd probably just go with, you know, 70 people. I feel there's 70 people that I'll see throughout the week or study with - or not throughout the week, maybe throughout the month - whether it be for clubs or studying or classes or tests, whatever. But yeah, that's what I say.  

**How many years have you been in your major?**  

I've been in my major for two years.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**

So I mentioned before, I think coming from the Bay Area definitely plays into choosing to do computer science and engineering. So both my parents were software engineers, so I knew that if you were to do software engineering, it could, you know, lead to a good, comfortable life. I don't think money is a major issue with software engineering. So that was definitely one factor, but I think the major factor for me was growing up, I was always into math. I did a lot of math competitions, like AMC, AIME, that type of stuff, and I was into them. Problem solving is obviously a major part of math, and I think going into college, I always thought I would be a math major.  

But then I found computer science to be more fun. And to be honest, I really didn't know what I was gonna do going to college. I was just like, "I'll just do math because I'm good at it". Not because I wanted to do it. But then I saw computer science as a way to do problem solving for fun and all, and to be honest, everyone around me was doing computer science. Like my entire friend group back home, 10, 15 kids, every single of them was a computer science major at college. So I think just having that environment where everyone around you is doing computer science kind of led me to also want to do it. It's not something I regret or anything - for me, I didn't know what I wanted to do, and computer science was the obvious choice along with math. So I just went and did computer science.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Academics? I think...I'll go two stories, if that's okay. My first story is my freshman year, first semester - obviously there was COVID so it was completely virtual, but I was on campus in the dorms and I was taking EECS 203, EECS 280, physics 140, and another engineering class. So it was a decent schedule. It wasn't too rough, but I would still say it was a decent workload. I think having physics and two EECS classes, especially after high school where I hadn't worked for the entire second semester - because, well, it was second semester. So I figured it was time to ramp up a little bit. But, um, my story was in EECS 280, I just had a habit of starting projects one or two days before, just because me and my roommate were both taking 280 and we had decided like, if we just focus for a few hours, we can just get it done.  

So I think I did that with euchre as well. I started I would say a few days - not two days because I heard it was difficult - but I started a few days before the deadline. I think that was the first time in my life I ever had to pull an all-nighter, I think. I remember just for whatever reason, the code wasn't working, it was breaking, couldn't pass even public test cases that they gave us. Even running it locally, it was just failing. And I remember at that time, it was the first time in my life where I personally thought that I could not get something done, where I was like, "Okay, this is out of my capacity, this is out of my mental capacity, this is out of my emotional capacity, I don't have the willingness or the, you know, mental capacity to actually finish this". I remember just staring at the screen at 4:00 AM, just thinking "Okay, when is this gonna end? Is this it for me?" Because I remember projects are like, if you just get a zero on a project, I mean, that's pretty... <laugh> That's pretty bad for your overall grades. I remember thinking to myself, "Okay, this might be it, I have time for a new major" or "I'm gonna have to pass / fail this", thankfully because we had the pass / fail option for when COVID was there. 

I do remember eventually I completed it a day before the deadline, and it worked out okay. But I think that was memorable for me for two reasons. One, I'd never pulled an all nighter before in my life. That was like the first time I ever did something so extreme to study. I think that was the only time ever. And the second reason was because I genuinely felt like this was something I cannot - this is something, no matter how hard I try, I cannot accomplish, it's out of my mental league. So that was something which was really interesting to me, something kind of really memorable to me. 

Another story I would say was last semester when I took EECS 376. It was like a CS theory course, and I remember it was the first time out of all the classes at UofM where I looked forward to going to lecture. I feel like a lot of kids, you know, maybe they love going to lecture; for me, it's not something I'm really into. I like reading the textbook or reviewing stuff at my own pace rather than going to lectures - because in lectures, I feel like no matter how hard I try to stay focused, I always lose focus, because I don't do good with audio learning. I would rather sit and read a textbook and learn at my own pace or look at a worksheet and learn at my own pace. But EECS 376 was the first class I've taken where I was able to go to lecture and actually focus for the full 80 minutes. I think it has to do with me liking math. And I think the fact that...in a lot of classes at UofM, they'll have an introductory lecture about a topic. For example, in EECS 370 they'll have an introduction about a topic, and then the next lecture will build off on that, third lecture will build off on that. What I'm trying to say here is if you lose focus on the first lecture, you're like 30 minutes behind. Then if you go in the day after to the second lecture, no matter how hard you try, you'll already be behind, mainly because the lectures build upon each other. It's like a snowball effect; the amount of information you're behind keeps growing and growing. So that's definitely something that sucks about lectures, but 376 is a different class for me.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

An average semester?...I'm trying to give a ballpark estimate. Okay, so I probably work six days a week; I don't really work on Friday or Saturday, I would say. Going to lecture and stuff like that doesn't count, right?  

**You should count whatever you would consider work or busy time.**

Okay. Um, I feel like I work around six hours a day during school. Maybe more, but that's like 36 hours a week.  

**Okay. And what is the average number of rest hours you got per week in an average semester? I should specify waking rest hours, so time that you spend resting during the day.**  

Sorry, what does that mean? Uh...okay, I get that actually. So you're just saying resting time when you're not sleeping, right? During the week, probably...I don't know. I don't get a lot of time. Within working out and clubs and that type of stuff, probably an hour a day. So times six, six hours. Plus I guess I get one day off, and that day is probably six hours or eight hours. So I would say around 14 hours.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

My busiest semester...I think I was working my rest day for about four hours, and the other days I'd work probably like 8, 9, 10 hours? It was probably a lot. I'll just go with 44 maybe. Or maybe 52 actually. Yeah, I think it's 50-ish. Fifties? Yeah. Probably 50.  

**And for that semester, what was the average number of waking rest hours you got per week?**

Per week, probably like five.  

**Okay. What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

Uh, literally waking up at nine and then studying until one. Obviously all that time wasn't studying. <laugh> Let me think...maybe 12 hours a day. That's a lot, but that's probably actually it. So maybe 72, something like that? Actually, no, that's not true. I don't think I ever did 72. It's probably I think in the sixties, maybe? Sixties. Yeah.  

**Can you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Yeah, for sure. I think one example of this is finals this last semester. I was taking EECS 370, EECS 376, which had finals pretty close to each other. So it was interesting because I think they were a day apart or something like that. So in the preparation week, I had to study for both classes because it wasn't like, "Let me just study for EECS 370 first and then just take 376", because it was obviously just one day apart. So it's not ample time, and I'd have to switch off studying for those classes along with a few other classes - but those two were the main classes I studied for. And it was really rough because I would, you know, I would try to wake up at around 9:00 AM, 8:30 AM, 8:45-ish, leave the house by 9:15 AM, get to north campus, and then I would be studying there until lunch. 

And then a major issue I have with these weeks is getting food, just because I don't want to eat out for every meal, but it's also hard to make stuff or waste time walking somewhere cheaper, stuff like that. So I remember just eating Panda from the Duderstadt way too many times! But yeah, I would say for just an average day, I wake up at 9:00 AM, get to north campus by 10:00 AM, study from 10:00 AM to like 12:30 PM or 1:00 PM, get food, maybe go to review sessions from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, and then go back to the EECS building or something and study until 7:00 PM. If I had time, I would try to work out for an hour from seven to eight, then have dinner at one of the dining halls with a dining pass. And then after that, go back home or to Shapiro and study from around nine to one; then just do that for four straight days. Yeah.  

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I feel I have little control. I think this is a survey question and maybe a Michigan survey as well...but yeah, I'm pretty sure I would say I don't have much control over my time, mainly because...like if you take difficult classes together, they demand such a high part of your schedule along with commitments such as research and clubs - I'm part of a club sport team, so that also takes up time, because we have practices and socials and that type of stuff which are pretty much mandatory. Even if it isn't mandatory, I think if you make a commitment, you should probably keep it; that's something I try to do. But definitely, I would say I don't have much control over my time, mainly because classes demand such a big aspect. It's not like I can do what I want with my time because the assignments have to get done, the projects have to get submitted, the studying has to be done, the lectures have to be watched...yeah.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yes and no. I think UofM definitely sparked an interest in me for computer science and learning engineering. I look forward to taking different classes now. I never really liked school that much, but now I genuinely look forward to going back to campus in a few months and being able to study computer science and whatever different classes I'm gonna be taking. But the "no" aspect is that I think UofM...I think there's also a certain amount of work that I know that can happen. I think going to college, I didn't expect the workload to be as high as it is with some of these classes, especially to take them together.  

So I think yes and no. The enthusiasm for learning new things, 100%. But there's also I think a new fear in me of, "Oh my God, there might be weeks where I have to study for like, let's say, from nine to one repeatedly four days a week". And I have to be really efficient with my time, So that's something that kind of worries me, because I think it's just added pressure to be efficient with your time. It's kind of difficult to do.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

I don't think so, no.  

**Okay, could you elaborate on that?**  

Yeah. Um, I'm not sure what you mean by energy level, do you just mean in general?  

**Yeah, just in general.**  

I think coming into UofM, I always knew that doing well in academics was a big part of my life, but I think I personally place more value in other stuff, such as - sounds cliche, but literally just being a good person. And then sports is something I care about a lot about. I care a lot about my body and working out, whether that be biking - I love to bike - uh, hiking...I think something that's stayed consistent throughout my time at UofM and before UofM is that I've always done, uh, - this sounds small, but I always play fantasy sports, always watch sports, I always engage in sports. Things like that. So I would say my interests have stayed the same, and I think having that stayed constant throughout UofM has been really good. I was a big fan of one sport in high school, so now being on that club sport team at Michigan means I get to continue doing that. So I think a lot of these interests have stayed the same, which has helped keep me the same person I was before.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

I would say if you just look at pure grades, maybe there's a very, very slight decrease. But to me, no, I don't think so. No, I think no.  

**Alright, shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

My goals are usually unrealistic, so I very rarely accomplish them. But I think I do that purposely because there's some saying, I forgot. Like "shoot for the stars, land on the moon" or something? <laugh> I'm not sure if that's what it is. So I think I make unrealistic goals, whether it be short-term goals, like "Today I'm gonna study from X time to Y time, and then in that time I'm gonna finish three lectures and finish an entire homework". So I set unrealistic goals because that kind of pushes myself to try to get there. It's better than for me, in my opinion, setting goals where it's like, "Just watch one lecture in three hours" so that it won't force you to be complacent. So I think I do set a lot of unrealistic goals. Even for internships, I'm gonna be like, "I want to have four offers by this month", right? You know what I mean? Just unrealistic goals, because I think complacency is something I really try to fight against. That's why I would say I set unrealistic goals for myself, so I accomplish them very rarely because they're unrealistic.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**

Yeah, I was definitely a very strong student. I was never...okay, so I transferred from a lower ranked public high school - in like, a decent community, but it definitely was not academically focused at all. It was just a lower ranked, average American public high school that I went to my freshman year. Then my sophomore, junior, and senior years, I did this more standard barrier, competitive high school. I think I was a strong student at both high schools, but at the first high school, the less challenging one, I would say I was definitely the best or one of the best, because it was just lower competition stuff like that. Then moving to the second high school I went to, I definitely wasn't the best anywhere. There were probably a good 30 kids, all extremely smart, the geniuses I would say. So I went from being the best to not the best, but I still stayed strong academically. I still did pretty well, I would say...I've had a taste of both.

**Do you or have you ever felt pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Yeah, I felt pressured to be superhuman. Not explicitly, like someone's telling me "Take all these classes, do all this while doing this", but I think having certain friends around me - it's great having really smart people around you, but also sometimes you look at the things that they're doing...I mean, you just have to compare, especially if you're in the same boat as like, fellow EECS majors. So one of my closest friends, last semester he took 370, 376, another upper-level EECS class, and he took a really difficult math class. Those are four really hard classes! <laugh> I was just like, "Oh, wow, okay. This guy's really pushing himself." So I think I felt pressured to be superhuman like that, like work all these hours just because people around me were doing it. But I've never...yeah. I think just the environment sometimes definitely has. I think it's easy to ask yourself "If he's doing it, why can't I?" You know what I mean?  

**What is your relationship with failure?** 

Relationship with failure? Let me think...I think a lot of people say they like failure, they don't avoid failure. But I think for me it's kind of the opposite. I do not like failure at all. I think it's just something that...well, okay, there's a difference. Failure for me I feel is a strong term. I wouldn't use it a lot, because - I think I was mentioning with my goal setting before, but if I didn't finish three lectures in X amount of hours, I wouldn't consider that a failure, because I knew it was unrealistic. I think failure for me is when I really let myself down, be it whatever aspect of life: academically, emotionally, socially...I think failure for me is when I let myself down, when I know that I did something I should not have or could have done better. So yeah, I try to avoid failure.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I think like a lot of people, I don't really know how to react. I just, um, I accept it. But it's not something I encourage. It's something which I accept, I thank them, and then I move on. Academic praise, especially from family or something, it's obviously meaningful, but it's not something I feel that, like, I necessarily should deserve. Or even if I do deserve it, it's not necessarily something I feel has to be said. It's just something that I think I accept, but I try not to put too much thought into the praise or make it a bigger deal than it has to be.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

When I succeed, I think it's feelings of optimism, knowing that I stepped over one goal, one path stepped over, you know, knocked over one rock. That just means I can do more. It's all optimism and confidence for me. I think whenever I succeed, it's a great confidence boost, knowing that I can do something. I think it helps lead me to future successes. That's why if I accomplish an unrealistic goal, it'll be like, "Wow, I can do that, so that means I can do a lot more". So I think for me it really helps me build up more upon myself and grow forward.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I think most people who see me succeed react with kindness, and I think they're truly proud of me, which is obviously great to have, having a nice support system like that. I do think there's also...like if I was to post on LinkedIn or something about success, I do think there's also a good amount, like, not like a small fraction of people who would feel envy and whatever those feelings are. I think there's envy. I think the general feelings are, uh, people being happy for me. It's maybe hopefully inspiring for people, and then there's always gonna be envy. I think it doesn't matter what you do.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Have I heard the term burnout before? Yes I have.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

In my own words...let's see. To me, burnout is a loss of motivation and a great loss of excitement and self-confidence. I think for me, when someone says burnout, I feel like that word invokes a loss of confidence and self-motivation to accomplish whatever goals they had previously set in their lives or be themselves again. I think loss of motivation and loss of self-confidence come hand-in-hand. If you lose your motivation to do something, you also lose the ability to believe that you can do something. So yeah, I think that's my definition of burnout.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Imposter syndrome...yes, I have?  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

In my own words, imposter syndrome is when there's a feeling of...not feeling good enough to be where you are, feeling that everyone around you is smarter than you, and feeling that you simply don't belong.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah, I do believe I have. I think I've experienced short bursts of burnout. Uh, do you want me to talk about a time?  

**Yes, go ahead.**

Okay. For my second semester at Michigan my freshman year, I was at home that semester because there wasn't dorm housing. So I was doing everything remotely, didn't see any of my Michigan peers, and I think that's the first time in my life I probably experienced some burnout. I think contrary to popular belief - popular belief is that burnout happens when you're working too hard and then you can't work any harder anymore. For me, I think it was the opposite. I think being at home and not seeing people around me working made me think it was okay not to work as hard as I probably should have been working. So I think that's when I experienced burnout, because I just lost some motivation, which also led to a loss of self-confidence and doing things that - I remember just taking a course on my schedule that I thought would be too much, even though deep down, I knew I could probably handle it. But I was losing confidence in myself, a lot of confidence that I now have and have had, to be able to do courses or work or whatever it might be. So I would say yeah, I definitely experienced burnout for that semester. It wasn't from working too hard; I think it was just from the environment I was in. And as I mentioned before, a lot of lack of motivation.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

No, I don't think I ever have. I mean - okay, sorry. Yes I have, but I haven't experienced it for long periods of time. I think for me...I've, like, identified the feeling. I've been able to say "This is imposter syndrome", but it happens for me only for short periods of time. I think generally for me, what happens ...for example, I'll step into an EECS lecture, and then maybe some people will ask really difficult questions or just show a higher understanding. And then obviously I'll feel like I don't belong. That's what happens to me, but then I think that's just kinda a short term feeling. When I see it in front of me, it's like, "Oh my god, these guys are way smarter than me and work way harder".  

But then after maybe a few hours or a day or two, I think that feeling just fades away, because I can just identify as imposter syndrome. Also, I try not to compare myself too much with others; that's another thing which helps with that. But yeah, I think just short-term definitely, definitely happens for me in the short term, especially when I'm new to something - for example, my internship this summer; I think walking in there and seeing all these full-time people or even other interns, being like, "Wow, these guys are truly amazing with what they can do with a computer". I've definitely experienced it in the short term, but not in the long term.

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I believe it's moderately prevalent. It's definitely there, especially because there's a culture of competitiveness that's always gonna be surrounding CS. Because you know, we'll have curved tests or just getting an internship which everyone wants - like everyone applies for that Apple internship, you know what I mean? Like everyone is gonna apply for the software internships or whatever, platform internships, machine learning internships, everyone applies for the same ones. So yeah, I think it's definitely moderately prevalent.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

Imposter syndrome? I believe imposter syndrome is very, very prevalent amongst my peers. I feel like a lot of people don't know - especially I think at a big school like Michigan - you really don't know how smart the other kids are, you don't know how much they're working. I think if you ask someone by default "Do you think that other kids in your class work harder or work more hours than you are working?" or "Do you think they are smarter than you", they'd probably say "Yeah". But because you don't know the answer to that question, I think people default to "Oh my god, yeah, I've been looking at that guy, he seems to be taking so many notes during lecture and he's definitely super smart and talented". So yeah, I definitely think it's super prevalent just because at a big university, you really don't know what goes on with the lives of other people. I think the default is to assume that the grass is always greener on the other side, that they're doing more work than you or working harder, that type of stuff.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah, I think I mentioned before in that story of burnout. I mean, I can't blame it solely on the pandemic, but I think it's definitely made it harder. It definitely impacted my burnout due to a loss of motivation because of not seeing people, not being in environments I'm used to, being in new environments which I didn't react well to - I think just studying from home for an entire semester sucked due to the pandemic. I definitely think it gave me a sense of a lack of motivation. Yeah.  

**Close to wrapping up: considering everything we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

I enjoy my academic work, yeah. I think I have excitement to learn new things. I think I said this before, but I also do fear it a little bit because I feel like there's always another challenge. It can always get harder, and obviously the harder it gets, the more hours and the higher probability of failure. But yeah, I definitely do enjoy going to school every day and learning something completely new and different.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I wouldn't say I was very conscious. I think my first interactions with these two terms was in the EECS 280 lecture; I think they just have an entire lecture devoted to it. So yeah, I didn't know what imposter syndrome meant. I heard the term, but I never knew what the term meant. Then burnout, I wasn't very conscious of it. I probably experienced some of these feelings, but I was not very conscious at all before attending here.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Yeah, I think regarding those two things, I would tell myself to simply have more confidence. I believe the solution to both of those is just being self-confident, understanding that you do have the ability to do things which you don't believe you can do, or that you are really intelligent. Yeah. I think the biggest thing to myself is if I had someone to tell me "You're doing it the right way", or "You are extremely intelligent". That's what I would think I would tell myself. I think it's just a big confidence thing, just knowing that I can do it would definitely help. So I think just being confident in myself.   

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

No, I think I'm good. I think you covered a lot. <laugh>  

**Alright. In that case, that's a wrap. Thank you for your participation and I will stop recording.**
