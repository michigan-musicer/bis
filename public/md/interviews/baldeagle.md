**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Yeah, so I transferred to UofM from a different school. I actually primarily applied to business schools during my high school senior year, and I was accepted to the business school there. But then I also enrolled myself in a mathematical and computer science major there, and I was doing really well, even though I would end up having to take a ton of classes. So academically I was doing well. After I transferred here to UofM, a major setback was that I lost a lot of credits. So I had to take extra classes to make up for that. But overall I think I'm happy with the result, with the degrees I finally got at the end. Yeah. 

**Approximately how many people did you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**

Oh, uh, okay...it's less than a hundred. I actually arrived in 2019 fall semester, And we went into COVID in my second semester there. So, uh, my entire senior year was virtual. That was interesting. Yeah, I would say maybe, I don't know, around 40, 50 people? Something in that range, yeah.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your majors?**  

Um, I was in computer science throughout UofM, so that would be two years. I added the data science program as soon as I got there, so that's also two years, But I only added the math minor at the end of my first semester, so that would be 1.5 years.

The math minor was actually the hardest to get.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your majors and minor?**  

For the minor, that's easiest to answer. I was very interested in data science at that time, and I felt like I could really benefit from more math classes. The math classes are really hard at UofM, as you know, so I felt like it was really was worth, um, the mindfuck, in terms of tuition. It was quite valuable. The classes I took were hard, challenging, and I had to go to office hours a lot. So that's the motivation for the math minor. And then obviously because I was into data science, I picked up data science. And I know that, computer science - I mean, computer science just opened so many doors. And a lot of data science people also do computer science, so I kept computer science. It wasn't hard to do computer science and data science at the same time. Just some extra classes, but not too many.  

**Okay. What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Well, the most memorable academic experience probably one was taking 370? Um, I don't know, most memorable academic experience...that's really, that's - I mean, the first thing that came to my mind just now was for my last semester, doing the finals, I had to do so many practice exams. Especially for 370, I think I did a ton for 370. What else? Then another very memorable experience was 376. It's one of the required classes, right? So yeah, that one, oh my gosh. Our final was completely open book. We had like a whole day to work on it, but the professor - I don't quite remember his name. He was really good, and I loved him as a professor; but the exam, he was so confident. He said,  

"It's okay if you just spend two hours only, because more time won't help you". <laugh> Can you imagine hearing a statement like this? It turned out to be...it's crazy. Well, it was an insane experience, because I had a whole day, I had so much time, but there was one question I just couldn't solve. I kept drinking red bull, trying hard to, you know, think about it, but I could not answer the question.  

So that's a specific experience. Yeah.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

For school or including the actual things I did, like study outside?

**Include whatever you would consider work, so not necessarily just time spent in class.**  

Oh, I see. Well...I was pretty stressed out in my first year, because I had to secure an internship for the summer. So I had to work, like...man, that's a hard question! That year I had more stress than the second year, but the second year I actually worked more, because - I don't know, work became more enjoyable, something like that. So for the second year I probably was working...how many hours a day? Um, can I just tell you how many hours a day and then you can convert it?  

**That works too.**

So for the second year I was working probably...so I had to sleep for eight hours. So this minus 16 and probably played for like a few hours each day. Oh, actually I use an app. I can actually tell you the exact numbers, but that would take some digging. Probably I would say the second year was 14 hours, or maybe 12 hours? So let's say 13 hours a day. And then for the first year, I was working less probably...throughout that I was doing, I don't know, eight to 10 hours a day? I would say 10 hours would probably be more like it, yeah. And then I didn't consider summer or winter breaks, there were like two weeks in each one where I would just spend, you know, chilling. Yeah.  

**So just to check, 91 per week, 13 times seven for the first year and 70 per week for the second year. Is that correct?**  

Uh, yes, but it's the reverse So first one would be 10, second one would be 13.

**Okay, my bad.**

**For an average semester, what is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week? When I say waking rest, I mean time that you're taking to relax during the day.**  

Oh, I just assume I slept like eight hours on average. So it would just be, you know, 24 minus eight minus whatever I just said for studying or working. Yeah.  

**Okay. So 42 for the first year and 21 for the second year? Something like that?**  

I think so. Yeah.

**This might be answered already by the math that we've done, but what is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Yeah. I would say the busiest one would be the last semester. First semester of my senior year, I was doing a lot of leetcode and doing interviews, but after every major interview, I would take some time to chill. But the second semester didn't have any interviews, and I took a ton of classes. I don't know, I was just in flow throughout the semester. That semester went really nicely; most of the time I worked nonstop        

Oh, actually I was doing some study time competition, actually. Usually I'm able to rack up like...throughout the semester I was able to rack up around maybe 15 hours - no, not 15 hours. Maybe like 14, I'd say. 

**Per day?**

Yes.

**...A little over 100 per week? Assuming seven days of that week.**  

Yeah. I kind of have to tell you these numbers just, uh, from memory. It's possible that people overestimate how much they have worked.

I definitely assume I do that. Yeah. But the good thing is that I actually have records of all those numbers, so that's interesting.

Yeah. This app is pretty nice. If you can get people to share their hours - I tried actually. So I was very interested in sharing mine, but there wasn't a way to do it automatically. Each one had to be exported individually. So I just wrote a script that would constantly do it and use their API. It's not the easiest thing to do. They have GitHub repos, you know, that I will analyze. But they're not set up the way I wanted to get it automated.   

**For that last semester that you had, what was the average number of rest hours you got per week? Again, waking rest.**

I see. I would say probably...I feel like I didn't cook at all that semester. Oh, yeah. I only quit a little bit during the break. I'd probably just say, like...shower was actually considered relaxation. I was listening to some really good audiobooks, highly effective. Um, yeah. Just 24 minus the study time, and if you wanna take all the sleep time, maybe 7.5 or eight hours...average of sleep is maybe 7 hours 45 minutes? Yeah. And then the rest would all be relaxation. [This should be an average of 2.5 hours of rest per day.] I didn't have to do many house chores - pretty much I had to take out trash.  

**Okay. What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

It was actually during the winter break. I finished all the exams and I had a lot of free time, so I just worked on a personal project I was super passionate about. I would say that I definitely spent the entire time working - I was actually also doing a challenge with a friend, so probably spent at least five hours a day...I would definitely say just 16 hours a day for, uh, I probably did it 10 days. Yeah, around 10 days. It was from Christmas till new year. That's actually about six days, but - no it was 24 to 1. Yeah.  

It was pretty nice. Yeah.

**How much control do you feel you had over how you spent your time?**  

Are we talking about self-discipline or are we talking about external, like, you know, tasks? Like I'm required to do homework or whatever.

**People have talked about both, so you can talk about either one or both, whatever you'd like.**  

In college, I would say that in the first semester of my senior year, I was only taking four classes. So I felt like I had a ton of time to work on leetcode and stuff. Almost half as much time I would say, because I sometimes would spend one week doing leetcode straight and then one week doing all the assignments, because you know, a lot of them are just projects with two week, three week deadlines. Yeah. So that literally went on for a few months. It was pretty crazy. That's definitely 50%, but then the worst case would be the last semester because I was taking a ton of classes. I literally did not do anything - I mean, I did a little bit of something else, and I did have a bit of a chance to relax at very infrequent times. I would say 90% of the time would go towards what I'm asked to do instead of what I can actually plan. Yeah.   

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Oh, I think if anything, I'm more passionate for academics. Some people are wonderful, really smart, really driven. I think when I was at my prior institution, a lot of people didn't take academics very seriously, and I heard there were a lot of cheaters, and you know, in the school library a lot of people were just playing video games or whatever. But at UofM, I think...I feel like people took academics very seriously. There are a lot of doctorate students that I got to know. Yeah, I think if I ever go back to school, I think I would really enjoy classes and academics. Yeah.   

Even though I ended up just like, joining industry right off undergrad. A lot of it is because of money.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

I would say the first semester was, uh...the first half of the first semester was kind of rough. I definitely lost a lot of energy, 'cause it was a new environment. It was a harder transition than I imagined, but after that transition was done, I felt much better.

I got to know some really nice people and found new hobbies, things like that. So I think my energy level was expected. It didn't really change much in the end. Yeah.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Change in academic results...I would say that I learned more from my classes per class. Um, let's see...so in the past, I would always read the textbook as well, but at UofM, I didn't continue to do that. Because  I didn't have the time for all the classes - I only did that for a few classes, I mean, for the classes I couldn't manage. There were actually only a few classes that I didn't read textbooks for, and that's actually meaningful to me because before that, I always read the textbooks. So that's pretty meaningful in terms of the end results. In terms of GPA, the COVID policy of masking grade was interesting, and uh, I masked one course. The others I chose to just leave them to be instead of mask them. Nothing really changed cause I already had a non-4.0 before I came.   

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Um, I was doing really well because I only had like, two goals. One was to do work, another was to find good internships or jobs. I think they both went well. For the smaller goals of doing leetcode or completing assignments, I think they both went pretty well. Yeah. So I was able to do it, you know, decently. Part of the reason was obviously because of the competition study time; it drove me to study and work. Now I kind of have grown tired of these things. So now it's a completely different story. Now I procrastinate more!

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Uh...So I started my high school in China and then I transferred to a public high school, and then a private one. So when I was in China, I was only there for like one year and two months. There were two types of classes. One was regular classes, which I started with because I had an entrance exam and I just did okay. And then there were special classes, you know, for people who did really well academically and people who got the better grades in the exams. They got put in the better classes. And people who didn't do well in the better classes, they would get taken out into regular classes.  

So once I was in regular classes, half of the time I was actually the one who got the highest scores. Like I even surpassed the second one by over a hundred points! <laugh> That was pretty crazy. So that's the time I was like the best. After I went to public high school, I don't think I was the best, because...I mean, I was just, I was having a great time. I couldn't focus that much in school actually. And then in private high school, oftentimes for computer science or statistics I was often the best. But there are strong people in many of the classes, like cultures and in literature. I was definitely not the best in those; I was middle, or slightly better probably. I mean, okay, upper tier for sure. Then let's see, what else? At my first college, sometimes...let's see what I did, took a lot of business classes...  

Yeah. For some business classes, I was definitely the best and professors loved me. Then for math class I was not the best. Computer science, not the best. At UofM, I was rarely the best. <laugh> But that's not a bad thing. A lot of people I can learn from, and that's awesome. Yeah.  

Just to add a point. I forgot to mention once I got into the special classes, I was not the best. I was actually in the middle, very consistently. I mean at one point I was upper tier, and then I slid down.

**Did you ever feel pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Superhuman at UofM...Okay. I mean, last semester I took a ton of classes, but mostly I pressured myself, right? Like I took on the challenge of taking a ton of classes, and I was definitely working in some kind of superhuman mode for sure. I can say that very confidently, because I had to work so much. It was pretty crazy. I didn't even know I could pull that off, but I did.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

Who,  

**Uh, failure? What is your relationship with failure?**   

Uh, I get depressed by failures...I'm kidding. No, no, I get depressed by setbacks. But in terms of failures, they don't happen that much.  

For academics, I never really aimed for 4.0. So the major goals, they were okay. But sometimes if the major goals had a failure, then I maybe start to doubt myself a bit. Not a bit, but for a period of time. Yeah. Um, I don't know like what else you're looking for?  I think I probably just react like regular people do. Yeah.  

**Okay.**  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Um, academic praise...I'm used to them. I'm not really excited. As a matter of fact, at one point I told a professor I didn't like them because they make me, uh, too content to not work harder.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

When I succeed...I deserve it. <laugh> Yeah. I don't attribute it to luck or anything. Or religion or whatever. Yeah.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I don't think my parents cared that much, unfortunately. One of the reasons why I didn't care about 4.0 was they just - at first they were happy, and then, you know, after some semesters they didn't even reply. <laugh> They didn't even bother to reply about me saying, "I got another 4.0". In terms of friends, I think...how do they react to my successes? No one's really jealous or anything, some people are just genuinely happy and, um, sometimes impressed. Yeah.

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah. 

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

I would say burnout is just the feeling of an imbalance in working hard and relaxation. A major symptom would be insomnia, or anxiety? Uh, sometimes it's the result of overcommitment. Yeah.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yeah.   

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

Imposter syndrome I would say is when someone feels like they are just pretending to be someone else. Kind of like faking it until you make it, but they are not even sure about themselves. They feel like maybe they are not qualified enough for the situations they put themselves in.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Oh, for sure. Um, yeah, I can get burned out from internships or work, just like jobs or whatever. Um, I can get burned from...let's see. So academically I don't get burned out as much because I mean, professors are nice, right? If you genuinely have situations like sickness and ask for extension, they happily grant you those. I had some kind of carpal tunnel problem at one point, and I got extensions for like a few of my assignments. 

**You said carpal tunnel?**  

Yeah, like if you use a mouse too much. It hurt a lot at that time. So yeah, it's one of the reasons why I wasn't too stressed by school. But in terms of finding jobs, yeah. Or the process of working, you know, 'cause I think school is less stressful in general, and I mostly get burned out by these things sometimes, maybe...there's a term called a fear of being ordinary. Yeah, it's pretty interesting...it's called FOBO. Yeah. FOBO ["fear of being ordinary"]. It's like - so basically I don't, er, I cannot be ordinary. It's very important. 

Sometimes I get burned out just thinking how ordinary my life has become. Literally. It's a lot of stress and anxiety.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Imposter syndrome? Let's see...I don't.

Yeah. I think I'm lucky to have been encouraged throughout my life to work hard and achieve the goals I have set. So I have always observed that I do not have imposter syndrome.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout was among your peers?**  

Burnout among my peers. I think it is probably...probably you get burnt out once in a while. And I think perhaps the majority of them do, although my peers in particular, a lot of them don't really get burned out. So it's...I don't know. I feel like it's less than I would just think there are among people? I think in general it would probably be a very frequent thing, but maybe people just don't talk about it. Maybe that's why.

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome was among your peers?**  

Imposter syndrome? Oh yeah. I know one of my current work colleagues has confessed to me about her imposter syndrome, which I think is completely unjustified.

So I think that's prevalent, and maybe sometimes it can happen to people of certain demographics - I've heard a TED talk about, you know, women in computer science and how to combat imposter syndrome. Oh, you know what actually - 'cause I immigrated here when I was in high school, I think a lot of international students might have imposter syndrome. Sometimes when they're playing a word game, right? Minister's cat or Wordle. But a lot of them don't even consider themselves, um, international? Like say if they study in the US, they don't really consider themselves as US students. They still call Americans "foreigners", which - I mean, you are here in the US! So I don't know if that's imposter syndrome. I would say, like, they're completely out of it. They don't even try to fake it. Maybe that's a more severe level of imposter syndrome. Yeah. I think they might even be better off if they had imposter syndrome. Um, yeah.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Uh, COVID-19, if anything, maybe it delayed my ability to understand or experience imposter syndrome, because COVID has always been a good excuse for failures or setbacks  or just not doing something that you thought you would do. For instance, I thought that where I am right now, there would be a lot of tech conferences. Actually, not really - I haven't found any in-person conferences, 'cause if it's virtual then it can be anywhere. It doesn't have to be where I am. So I blame that on COVID. I don't know if it's actually COVID or me not finding them - so I try to look up meetups and stuff. It's kinda weird, why aren't there any? Yeah, so I would say if anything, it helps reduce it.

People don't worry about that as much because they have COVID as something they can blame more.  

**Okay.**  

**Close to wrapping up: considering everything that we've talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work?**

Let's see. I don't like it when I have to repeat or retake classes. For instance, I learned dynamic programming and algorithms before coming to UofM, and I had to relearn them. That was not enjoyable for sure. Even if I know the concept really well, when I was doing the assignments of say, writing BFS or whatever, it felt just like grunt work. It felt like it did not even serve as something to help me get better at the material, but just repeating the exercise. It was just a waste of time. For new content, I think it's great. Yeah.

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**

I knew that they could happen. Imposter syndrome...I think the same level of awareness actually. So while I was in the private high school, it put a lot of emphasis on things like imposter syndrome, those kind of things. And I also took AP psychology myself and also social psychology, so I feel like I was already educated on these topics. So yeah, it's about the same, even though I did learn about imposter syndrome in some required class - EECS 496 or something? I don't feel like I had a dramatic change in awareness.   

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Imposter syndrome...maybe a little bit of imposter syndrome as a transfer student. It somehow could creep in my mind - in my math classes. <laugh> Not computer science or data science or stats, definitely not stats! But math classes man, oh! It's interesting to have these kind of different levels of challenges I face. But I would say that, you know, don't worry too much about math classes, or you are not an imposter, maybe. Actually, a lot of students were transfer students in my classes anyway. 

It's very interesting. I mean, not a lot, but it's a good proportion. I would say that math classes are harder than the other classes. There's self-selected people, so don't think that somehow you're worse at math. Because before I came to UofM, I was actually better. I would do better in my math classes than computer science classes, and they flipped since coming here. So pretty interesting. I was like, "What the heck was going on?" In terms of burnout, I would say...burnout is a real issue, but I was always kind of a work hard, pretty hard type. So maybe just be conscious of how hard you actually play. Yeah.  

Sometimes you play too hard. Yeah.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Uh, I didn't ask about what the project is for so that I can give a really fair and neutral response for all the questions. But I'm kind of curious, if you could share. If you can't, that's fine.  

**Yeah. The idea is that this will be part of an interview series that'll be posted online, and the hope is that for students who are going through imposter syndrome or burnout, particularly those who feel like they can't talk to people or don't have people to talk to in the first place, that this'll be a useful resource for those people.**  

Oh. Are you the only one working on it?  

**Yes.**  

Oh, nice. So it's a purely personal project.  

**Yes, it's not through UofM at all.**  

That is pretty nice for you to work on this.  

**The transcription is the part that takes the longest time, and I'm not looking forward to it.**  

Huh? I thought Zoom transcription was pretty good.  

**It's not. <laugh> If you want really accurate transcription - like it's fine for transcribing lectures, but for something more sensitive like this, you really don't want some of the mistakes that zoom does. I guess...it's very messy, I guess, the way that Zoom transcribes.**  

Oh, interesting. And accent as well, I'd assume. Yeah. I mean it doesn't get accent, right? Some of them probably don't do as well.  

**Yeah. Zoom isn't as good at accents. The solution I'm using right now is good at accents. I think it does struggle a little bit, but it's a lot better than Zoom in general, and I think also with accents.**  

Nice. Which one? 

**Uh, it's called Rev.ai. I'm mostly using them 'cause they're pretty cheap for the good transcription.**  

I see. Google also has some kind of transcription API, right? I think?  

**Probably?**  

Interesting. Nice. Yeah, there are some like foreign videos, mostly Japanese stuff. Sometimes I want to understand what they're saying, so I would use a website that would transcribe and translate at the same time. That was pretty nice.  

Oh, what I would say is that I asked a friend when I first came to UofM - because I was experiencing the transition - I told about my friend and asked about CAPS, and she told me she used it, but it sucked and didn't help much. So I didn't even bother contacting them. Yeah. I don't actually know firsthand how good they are, but that's what I heard. She didn't like it, just one person's anecdote. I actually haven't talked to others about it.   

**Were there other resources that you used that were better by chance?**  

No, actually I didn't have any good resources. So I think something like what you are doing would be quite helpful.   

**Okay.**   

**Alright, if that's it, then I'll go ahead and stop the recording.**
