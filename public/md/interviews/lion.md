**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Okay. I guess that would be high school. I went to a public high school. I also attended a magnet school for half the day. So it was a STEM focus school essentially. Half the day I'd spend there for math and science program classes, stuff like that. The other half when I was done I'd spend at my school; I'd be bused from one to the other halfway throughout the day.  

**Approximately how many people did you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Uh, I mean, generally speaking however large the department is. But more specifically, if you count the number of people I regularly interact with between project teams and just, uh, personal friends, I'd say 20 is a good ballpark.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your major?**  

Yeah, so I declared...I want to say first semester sophomore year. So I'd say three years.  

**And then for grad school, how long would that be?**

Yeah, two semesters. 

**Okay. What is the story of you deciding on your major for both undergrad and grad?**  

Yeah, so from high school, I knew I wanted to go into EECS. I took a few programming classes and I really enjoyed them, so I knew that's what I wanted to do. I didn't know if I wanted to focus solely on software or if I wanted to look at hardware as well, because computer engineering does both. Uh, in my engineering 100 class, I took microprocessors in toys, and it was a pretty interesting course. And there's a lower level software / hardware side as well, so there's a lot of verilog coding that goes in that class. So I thought that was interesting enough that I decided I'd declare as a CE major. It turns out that I mainly focused on software anyway, but I think there were still a number of classes I took as a CE major that became pretty useful, even during grad school, that I may not have taken had I been a CS major.  

And then for grad school - and my focus area of robotics specifically - uh, I took a few robotics classes, including my MDE [editor's note: major-design experience, a.k.a. a senior project] EECS 467, senior year. And I really enjoyed that. So I figured - I was interested in AI and ML as well, and robotics sort of leads heavily into that as well, if you're looking at artificial intelligence or intelligent behavior. So that's that.

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

I'd honestly say the first full semester we went into COVID lockdown, because of how strange it was. I'm sure this is going to be an answer a lot of people give, but for me it was a really different experience from what school generally was, both personally and academically. Academically I had a lot of project-based classes that semester - my MDE, for example - and a lot of that had to be done from home. So there was a lot of adjustment that had to be made. But personally, my parents had to go to India, uh, for family reasons. So I was alone for nearly the entire semester. I think there was maybe a couple of weeks in the middle of that where my mom came back, but yeah, I was living alone that entire semester other than that. I think it was my first time for an extended period of time living all on my own, without a roommate and with my parents out of the country. I guess it was stressful at times, but it was also, I guess, good preparation for now.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

Um, that's a good question. If I'm thinking about it...okay. So classes, I'm probably going to be spending around, let's say an hour and a half twice a week, or three times a week for an hour. So three hours a week per class, and I'd be taking three or four classes. That's 12 hours on classes alone. Homework I think would be an equivalent amount of time. So like, you know, 20 to 25 hours. And then with, with project teams, they might bump up to 30. I dunno.  

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester?**

Let me think about this...okay. Let's say 25 hours per week? Let's say I'm spending three hours a day in class, and assuming no COVID, an extra hour or so running to and from places. I guess I'd say I'd have three to four hours of free time at most per day.

So 21 or 20 for the week, maybe. I'm trying to make sure that adds up in terms of how many hours I actually have in a week...so I'd sleep for five to six hours a day. Um, I think I might be overdrawing hours here, but I think those are okay ballparks.

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**

Busiest semester? I don't think there's that much...no, there's one time, I think there's one time I took 18 credits in the semester. And some of those credits were 203 and 280, so that was definitely busier. I don't think it was like a full-time job busy, so I'd say maybe 30.  

**Mm-hmm. And then for that semester, what was the average number of waking rest hours you got?**  

Oh, one to two per day, and that's including meal time. So I think that went entirely to eating.  

**What is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

In a single week? I mean, okay, that could very well be 40, just because - I mean I'm not sure, but I know especially during like, end of semester or mid-semester deadlines, you have, you know, multiple projects and/or exams that are coming up at the same time. So I would feel comfortable calling that 40.  

**Can you walk me through an example of one of those weeks?**  

Okay. So...shoot, it's been nearly a year since I've graduated. But yeah, I guess, I'm trying to think -  

Okay. The semester I was taking I believe 445 - so a machine learning class, and I also had to take a tech-comm class and EECS 496 alongside my MDE. So there was one week where I had a paper due for tech-comm,  a project and write up due for 467, and a project due for 445. All basically on the same day, or within the same couple of days. So I ended up taking late days on two of those. But yeah, I'm pretty sure I spent nearly all of my waking hours working on one project or the other or eating.  

**How much control did you feel you had over how you spent your time?**  

I mean, for my waking rest hours, obviously I have full control over that. So like, eating, and then I might watch TV or play video games or something like that for the remaining time. The time I spent on classwork, I don't know. I don't feel like there was any way I could have reduced the time I spent. Maybe, I guess if I- I mean, there are ways I could have reduced it, I guess if I was studying or working more efficiently or something. But I never felt after the fact that...no, how do I wanna phrase this? I *do* feel after the fact that "Oh, I could have done this quicker", but it never happens that way, if that makes sense. 

So I don't know. I'd say I have a little control over it, but ultimately the work takes the amount of time that it's gonna take. And a lot of that is if you're waiting for something to compile or if you're debugging; it's just a matter of waiting for something to finish or it's a matter of luck. Just figuring out what was wrong. And there's not always...

Okay, I keep stopping! What I'm trying to say is there are a lot of tasks I worked on where you know, either you get it or you don't. And until you do, you just have to keep staring at whatever you're staring at. So some level of control, but some things just take the amount of time they're gonna take. 

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, yeah, so senioritis hit hard! <laugh> But no, I think pretty early on, I started prioritizing extracurriculars over actual schoolwork. I was never the best with attendance, and a lot of the time I'd catch up with recordings. Sometimes I just wouldn't. But I think very early on, I prioritized project teams or research teams - so either working on homework or working on that - over attending class in person. And I think I was lucky that a lot of EECS classes had recordings even before COVID. So that was always an option. I think as time went on, maybe not immediately post-COVID, but maybe later on post-COVID, even when we returned to campus for my final semester. I feel like at some point, it was just "I want to get this done".  

I guess part of that would be school stress, but especially final semester - I think a lot of that was that, you know, I'd rather be enjoying my final semester, especially since I'm finally back on campus for the first time in two years. So if there's something extracurricular or if there's something fun that I'd want to do before I graduate, I should do that now. So it's not that I completely disregarded school, it's just that I heavily deprioritized it in favor of - I wouldn't even say that I did any worse than I normally would for classes, but it was just that I spent a lot less time in class.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**

Yes. Oh god. <laugh> 

Yeah, so I think both before and after college, I had a much healthier sleep schedule, and that plays a role in it. But yeah, I think this goes hand in hand with me wanting to be done with it and wanting to do other things that I enjoy more. I don't know if there was a change before, but I know there's a definite change after. So I mean, right now I feel like I have a lot more control over my time and a lot more control over what I want to do. And it's not that my current company doesn't require working outside of normal working hours, because I do have to do that as well. It's just that, um, I feel like work is in some ways less and more flexible.  

Obviously you have to put in the eight hours regardless, whereas with college, it's not like a contiguous eight hours. There are classes and you have more control over how you want to schedule things, but with work, I think it's more flexible in that no one really cares when you start and end, as long as you're getting work done. So I normally start the day at around nine and end around five or six, but I can start later and end a bit earlier or a bit later. I can stop at four, come back later in the night if I have to finish something up, things like that. 

And it's not that I just regularly say, "Hey, I'm gonna take a half day today", but also there's a freedom to just walk away and come back later, if I need to take care of something or if I feel like I'm not being productive. Part of that is work from home as well. But yeah, with work, it's not like there's a concrete looming deadline, and if you don't meet this deadline then we're going to give up working on this project and you get a zero and you're fired. If that makes sense. Obviously there are deadlines, but it's not necessarily as strict as college was, in the sense that you can adjust deadlines if you feel you need to.  

I guess it was possible sometimes in college, depending on the situation, but...I feel like I don't know what I'm trying to say here, but I guess the main point is that I feel like I have a lot more control over my time as a full-time employee than I did in college.  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Not really. Uh, I mean, most of my grades were always at an A range, like A or A-...I think first semester of grad school was the one semester where I got anything less than A; I got a B+ in one of my classes. But that might have been just fatigue from COVID. I don't even think it was that, because my family was already home by that time. It might have been just in the specific class; I don't think there was any real trend behind it. I think it was just a one-off.  

I'm actually trying to think if I might have been tired of school in general. That was my first semester of grad school, and I think I declared for graduation from undergrad that semester as well. And I was doing my capstone project at the time as well. So that was also a pretty busy semester, or it was busier than I thought it would be. I took a lot of project classes, and the issue was that with taking a lot of project classes, you have a lot of projects due at the same time at the end of the semester. So I put a lot of work into my capstone and a lot of work into my other project classes, and I didn't focus on that as much as I should've. But other than that, I don't think there was an overall negative trend, or an overall trend at all positive or negative.  

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

So I think I have the issue, both professionally and personally, of over-promising. So I look at something and I think like, "Oh, I can do this". Like for example, at work, I'll look at a task and I'll go in thinking "Okay, I understand what I need to do, if I just sit down and work on implementation for a week, I think I could finish this". But the issue is 1. you're never really working on a single task full-focused. You usually have several responsibilities, like extracurricular and academic and personal stuff going on. So you're never able to say "I'm just gonna stay here and focus on this for a week and finish it". 

Also, I feel like I tend to underestimate how much time things will take. So in that aspect, it's not very realistic, but I find at least academically I found that for longer tasks - so for longer project based work - I generally was able to finish my projects to some degree of satisfaction by the deadline. So I'm able to deliver maybe not necessarily 100% of what I wanted to, but I think still it was a project that I was happy with most of the time.   

**Okay.**
 
**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**

I'd say I was...I don't know about "best", but I'd say a strong student.

**Could you elaborate a little?**  

Yeah. I was an honor roll student. Uh, my school handled things weirdly in terms of valedictorian and salutatorian where they just gave valedictorian to anyone who had a 4.0 or above with weighted GPA. So I ended up getting valedictorian. I think I was somewhere in the top five based on GPA - not that that is like a full measure, I'd say - but I'd say I was a strong student academically, at least before high school. My issue was that I wasn't - I had a couple extracurriculars that I did because I enjoyed them, but I was way more involved in college than I was in high school. And I think part of my reason for being more involved in college is that I felt...like, I wanted to take advantage of the opportunities I had in college more so than I did in high school.  

**Okay. Did you ever feel pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Probably yes, although I never saw it that way. So there was always, uh, pressure to complete X project or, you know, finish X task or get As for all my classes and stuff like that. Those were things that I aimed for and I never saw as superhuman. But it might be...okay, there are times at which I thought "I have more things to do than I have time to do them, even if I'm working 24/7 on all the things I have to do". So in that regard, I'd say yes, but I only ever saw it that way in hindsight. So when I was working on it, it was just a matter of, "I need to get this done", and then looking back on it, maybe I should have taken a late day or, you know. Like I'd end up taking a late day if I had to.  

And then looking back, I'd realize, "Oh, wow, I should have utilized my late days better because I have some left over", or "Oh, I should have planned better", or "I should have known I'd need to do this". or - yeah. There were several things where I could have done something differently. I'm way off topic now, back to the question. There are times where I had to get a number of things done, whether that be for extracurriculars or academics, where there was more work to do than I had time to do it. I didn't ever see it as superhuman, I just thought of it as something I had to do. But in hindsight, yeah, some of those expectations on myself might have been unreasonable.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**

Um, okay. I guess that's something else that changed. So it used to be something where I was, I guess afraid of it would be the best word? Although it wasn't necessarily a conscious fear. It was more - like, like I said in the previous question,  I always saw the work I had to do as something like "Okay, I have to do this, so let's just do it". And I always saw failure as something like "Oh, I, you can't let this happen". And it just, like, wasn't an option. I think over time and especially starting full-time, it's something where you understand that not everything is going to work the way you want it to or go the way you want to. And being able to adjust to that, being able to explain why, being able to come up with ways to work around it - those are all really important skills. And being able to communicate all of that is also very important. 

So I'd say it's something that actually got healthier as time went on, only because, uh, it actually very much had to at certain points. So yeah. I mean, I guess once again, it took time to realize that failure is normal and you're allowed to. But I'd say especially near the end of my undergrad and throughout grad school, I had a much healthier relationship with it than I did before college.  

**Okay. How did you react to academic praise from others?**  

Um, even now, it feels weird to receive praise. So I personally am proud of, you know, accomplishing things, when I get something done. I mean, for a trivial example, the grades I want. But for more serious examples, when I finish a project or when something that I've been struggling with for weeks starts working, I feel happy about that. But I guess I've become more self-conscious over time. I used to be very bad about it. I think especially in high school where I was I think overly proud of it, to the point where I would be obnoxious about it. Or like - I had a friend circle where we just openly compared how we did on tests and projects and stuff like that. And the thing is, that's fine within a circle of friends if everyone's okay with it. I feel like I might have taken it further than that, or with people who perhaps weren't in that circle. So I realized that's something that I needed to work on during college. 

I think I'm more self-conscious about that now, so I don't really necessarily broadcast information unless it's relevant to whatever I'm doing. And even then, I don't...I guess the response would be that I appreciate the compliments, but I don't really necessarily know how to respond. 

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Um, I guess at the very least happiness and a general sense of belief that whatever I'm working on is over. If it's something new or exciting, or if it's something I've been struggling with for a while, maybe a little bit of a sense of pride. If it's something which I think I shouldn't have been struggling on, extra relief. But yeah, I think that sums it up.  

Mm-hmm. How do you think others react when you succeed?  

I'd say at least among my friends, if it's something important to me, they're generally happy for me and they're there for me. And I'd say I have a similar attitude towards my friends. Outside of my friend circle, I can't really say, but it doesn't particularly matter, I guess. I mean, whatever their attitudes might be, it won't affect me, so it doesn't matter. But I guess for the people who are important to me, whether that be friends or whoever's leading the projects I'm working on, or my peers within the project teams, when I succeed they're generally happy for me. And I guess for project teams, when I succeed, they succeed as well, because team effort. So generally within project teams and within my friend circle, I'd say they're supportive. And then outside of that, it doesn't really matter to me.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Okay...that's a good question. I'd say, a reduced desire or completely losing desire to do things, even things that you're passionate about, because of stress or because of anxiety.  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

I mean, some sense that you don't belong somewhere, even when you might. So I've heard in the context of college a lot, believing you don't belong at the college or that you're not smart enough to be there, but more generally believing that you're not qualified enough or not deserving enough of some achievement or status, even when that might not be the case. Or for imposter syndrome, even when that is the case.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Not severe, but yes.  

**Okay. Could you elaborate on some of your experiences?**  

Yeah, so I think it's just a cycle where generally - um, I've noticed this. But generally every year, there's one round of exams that I'll do worse on than the others, and generally, not always, it's the final exam. So I think near the end of the semester, as projects and exams start piling up, it sort of becomes "I really want to get this over with" and I want to move on to break / next semester / graduation. So once again, it's not severe, but it's definitely a case of just wanting to be done and not putting in as much effort as I should because of it. I think the most severe case I had of it was the final semester of grad school before I graduated.  

It was not necessarily just because of burnout, but I found myself putting a lot less effort than I should have, even in extracurriculars that I previously enjoyed. So for example, even in more social or volunteer-based extracurriculars, I was just doing less than I should have. So emailing people less, responding to emails less frequently and with longer delays, just not doing things that I should have or that I wanted to do because I just felt I was preoccupied with other things. Some of it was that there was a lot going on that hadn't been in previous semesters, which I can't really elaborate on. But yeah, burnout might have played a role in that, especially towards the end of the semester.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

No, and I'm pretty confident I haven't.  

**Could you elaborate on why you haven't?**  

Yeah, I don't know. I've always had this sense of knowing that I'm a strong student, and that when I put my mind to something I can achieve it. So it doesn't really matter whether other people feel I belong or not; it's just a matter of, you know, "This is what I want to do, this is what I need to do in order to get there, so I'm going to do it". The feeling of "Do I belong here or not" never really crossed my mind; as far as I was concerned, I was accepted, so I belong. That's about it in terms of college anyway. I know people who have, and I know what that looks like. So I guess that was also an extra sort of sense of, you know, knowing how it affects people and knowing why it affects people. And then just understanding that those thoughts aren't correct or aren't valid - that was an extra safeguard. Like you know generally why people fall into thinking that way, so it becomes easier to avoid it.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

In college? Very high. I mean, I wouldn't know exactly, but I know a lot of people who have suffered from it, and I know a lot of people who suffered from imposter syndrome as well. I know several friends or several friends of friends who have had issues with that. I guess I have a smaller friend circle, but I generally have high opinions of them. So I feel like if it affected them as badly as it did, then it's likely something that is far more prevalent than you'd initially think, I guess. I don't know where I'm going with this. But even among my sort of small-ish friend circle, there are a lot of people who have suffered from it. So I think it's something that a lot of people suffer from, at least periodically.    

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

Uh, a lot as well. And I'd say, especially among freshmen - like I've heard a lot of stories of newer students, transfer students or freshmen, who come here and feel, because they haven't had the time to make the social connections that a lot of others have made, especially, uh - it becomes a matter of just not knowing that other people are in the same boat as you when it comes to classes, or not knowing what opportunities, what resources are available. Thinking that just 'cause I'm doing bad in this class, or just because I'm not doing as well as I'd like, that it means I don't belong, or in some cases - like from personal experience or from people I know - when you start falling behind on things, you sort of look around and see everyone else, and you assume that everyone else is keeping up with it and you're alone and struggling with it. When in reality nearly everyone is as well.  

**Mm-hmm.**  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Um, yeah. I'd say...how should I put this? My awareness has improved since then, but for reasons unrelated to COVID for the most part. These became bigger focus areas during COVID because a lot of people, especially with the isolation, started to feel it. I guess a lot of my experience with it has been from friends suffering from it, so a lot of my experience with it predates COVID to an extent. So it's definitely something that I saw talked about more once lockdowns happened, once quarantines happened, and even after coming back to campus. And it's something that I started talking about more with people as I got involved in certain volunteer organizations.  

I guess that is connected to COVID, but that's not necessarily because of COVID specifically, because I became more involved in specific organizations and activities where that became more relevant to what I was doing. But yeah, in some ways it increased awareness because it became something that a lot more people were talking about. It became something that a lot more people were consciously aware of and probably consciously facing. But at the same time, due to being isolated, due to being at home and basically out of contact with anyone outside my friend circle for nearly two years, it became something where you're less aware of how prevalent it is in your community, because your only sample is your friends basically. Yeah. 

**Wrapping up: considering everything that we talked about today, did you enjoy your academic work?**  

There was a lot of interesting work, and I enjoyed a lot of the projects that I worked on. Especially the projects that I did in grad school, they were incredibly interesting. Even outside of the context of being for a class, those were projects that, if I had the opportunity to work on them again, not for a grade but just for fun, I probably would. So I loved the project work. The homework was just something you have to do to learn the subject, so I don't really have a strong opinion on that one way or the other. But the project work I did enjoy. It's just with...I think the main issue I had during school wasn't with the work itself, it was the time crunch.  

**How conscious were you about burnout and imposter syndrome before attending UofM?** 

Uh, it's not really something that I saw discussed extensively before attending UofM. Those aren't things I was aware of before I attended, or at least not things that I consciously thought about.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Yeah, that's a good question. So for imposter syndrome, I've never personally faced it myself, so I don't think I'd have much advice to give on that. But for burnout, personally it would just be to, you know, remind myself that the semesters and time passes by much quicker than you can imagine. So just remain focused when you need to be, and you should be fine. I mean, how do I say this...the other advice I'd give myself is "A lot more people are facing this than you are aware of, and there are a lot more resources than you're aware of. So if you ever feel like you're overwhelmed, reach out." That's something I feel like I didn't do as much until later on in my academic career.  

It's something that I could have benefited from, maybe not necessarily just in terms of grades, but in terms of project work as well. So like, "Hey, I'm not really understanding what's going on. I am feeling overwhelmed. I don't know what to do," or "I don't know what to get involved with". Things like that, where I was lucky enough to have friends and resources early on that really helped me with that. But I feel like I didn't know how to fully take advantage of those opportunities until later on, so just for burnout specifically, learning when to ask for help is the biggest thing that I'd advise myself on.  

**Anything else you'd like to say?**  

I guess nothing comes to mind right now. But yeah, it's been an interesting interview, a lot of questions that I don't normally think about.  

**We'll leave it at that, then. I'll stop recording there.**
