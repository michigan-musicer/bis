**Just to warm up a little bit, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Yeah. So I was born in Indiana and started kindergarten through first grade. Then around second grade, so maybe 2008, I moved to Michigan and pretty much was just in the public education system. I think it was a fantastic school district. They offer AP classes, a lot of the students are very competitive academically...I wouldn't say it's to the same standard of a really prestigious private school or perhaps - I know some of the school systems in California can get really rigorous and very competitive. But yeah, they have lots of people taking standardized test prep, which is what I always think of when I think of a school district that's really well off, where people can afford to do that kind of stuff. So I would say I was definitely well-equipped with my academic background and education before college. And since, you know, Michigan is a state school, a lot of my peers were able to come to the University of Michigan as well. Yeah. Is there anything else that you'd like me to fill in by the way? Just interrupt me if you have any additional questions.  

**I think that's good. Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Okay. I guess in the sense that there's people that are from my high school and then, you know, the people that I'm actually close with. There's that sort of distinction. Basically friends or just people from high school. And then there's also an interesting dynamic, because around the Metro Detroit area, there's a lot of cities that are somewhat nearby that have similar backgrounds. So I think there's actually a study in the Michigan Daily about a couple of schools that made up or represented quite a large proportion of Michigan's in-state students. The city I'm from is part of that. Actually, a lot of these are public school districts, but they actually do show up quite a lot - and there's also the private schools. But back to my point about the peers is that people tend to come into the school with a larger social network, just because you have a friend, and then that friend might know other people from those other school districts.  

I guess I wouldn't say I was like, super well connected, but in the sense that, you know, you have a friend and that friend knows other people, so you already have a third degree connection when you come in, if that makes sense. 

**Mm-hmm. And then do you have approximate numbers for that?**  

I think in my year, from my specific high school, there was quite a bit. Might have been less than a hundred, but that's the sort of ballpark range I'm thinking about. Yeah, like a decent amount of people...but probably no greater than a hundred. Probably greater than 50, I would say somewhere in that range. I dunno if that helps. And then if I'm counting close peers that I came to school with, maybe 10. All that is kind of murky, with quantifying relationships, but I would say yeah, maybe 10 or 15 people I was pretty close with. Then the rest of them would be just, "Oh, I know of that person, but I don't actually *know them* know them".

**How many years were you in your major?**  

So I guess technically now it's been four years. And then yeah, that's pretty much it. We're not counting high school or anything like that right prior to college? 

**Nah.**

Okay.

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

So going back a little bit into family history, my dad was an electrical engineer, and so I think growing up, there was always sort of that like push towards - well, I guess he never explicitly pushed me, but I think I felt some small pressure to follow in his footsteps a little bit. And this was all entirely self-generated. And then growing up, you know, I liked playing video games, I liked doing stuff on my computer..just very naturally, I think my hobbies aligned with working with technology and that sort of stuff. So I think that was another reason there. And then within my social network as well, a lot of my friends were going in that direction and interested in it. And then last but not least, you know, I hear it's - like when I was first thinking about that sort of stuff, it's like, the lucrative, money-making option. And I was like, "Oh, that sounds cool".  

So then for me it just seemed like all the boxes were checked off. You got the family background because my dad was also an engineer; you have the friends that are doing a similar thing; you have, um, less of a concern of money and where I'm gonna end up after college...and so it seemed like a very safe and strong choice for me. I wouldn't say I had a particular passion for CS, I didn't really know much about it other than one high school class. As for psychology, that was actually maybe more of my real, like, "Oh, this is actually cool", like my passion. So I had a high school class, AP psych, and I really liked my teacher. I really liked learning about it. And at the time I thought I could just double major in both. I didn't really have, again, a deeper connection to that. It just seemed like an interest. So when I came to the University of Michigan, I just double majored CS and psych and I thought it was a pretty cool combination. You get the humanities and sort of the more, um, sciences. So I liked that I had that balance within my curriculum.  

**Okay.**  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Ooh. So should I distinguish between positive and negative memories or just purely based on how striking it was?  

**Uh, up to you? I'm just looking for an interesting story.**  

Interesting story. Hmm.  

Okay, so I don't know if it's memorable to me because the story itself is that interesting, but I guess my most memorable academic story was actually after I took 280 and 203. I found out later in the summer that one of my partners had violated the honor code - and I mean, I'm sure you're probably gonna get this response, like honor code stuff as like memorable stuff.  

But yeah, my partner, literally he - er, it wasn't even my partner. This guy, I gave him some code, because again, this was a friend from high school and he needed help. So I literally just gave him my test cases, and in my mind, the way I justified it was, "I'm not actually giving him any of my code, I'm just giving him test cases that can help you find bugs". So I guess that's how I internally justified it at the time. And again, I thought of this guy as my friend, and essentially what happened was this *motherfucker*, this guy just submitted my test cases. He just copy-pasted them and then I got honor-coded for that. And there were some other branching results out of that, but that whole experience is like a really - I was like, "Man, fuck this guy". <laugh>, I'm being completely honest here. Like, "Fuck this guy. I thought you were my friend, like who does that?" And he also denied it, saying "I didn't copy them. I don't know how that happened," and then he admitted it months later, like, "Oh, I just copied your entire test cases". But that was a pretty memorable experience, I'd say.

I have other memorable experiences, but I think that one probably takes the cake. I was just debating internally on whether I wanted to save that or not. But yeah.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

Ooh, okay. This is kind of a hard question for me because I think I really varied a lot in terms of my study habits and just my general academic rigor. So I'm gonna pace it off my, um - are we distinguishing between studying for exams, homework, are we homework as part of studying? 

**Whatever you'd consider work.**

Whatever I consider work...okay. In that case, probably I think 25 or maybe...maybe 30. It's hard to say. Definitely between 20 and 30, I think. 

**What was the average amount of rest hours you got per week in an average semester?** 

<laugh> I'm a college student, dude! I don't sleep! Um, probably eight hours, I think. So then that's a day, and then...like 56 a week. 

**What about rest outside of sleep?**  

Rest outside of sleep...yeah. Okay, that's a good question. So if you're stretching it over my entire school time, I would say very little, maybe less than 10, definitely less than five on average. I think a big learning lesson for me through college was clearly distinguishing between work and rest times, and I think this was something I learned later on, to actually intentionally not do work even if I had the opportunity to. So purposefully space out that time. I think when I first came to college, that was a big point of stress and anxiety: there's always something to do, there's always something you can be doing. It's just never-ending, ceaseless, you always have to think about "I could be doing this assignment next" or "I could start studying for that test next".  

And I think later on, I would finally be like, "Oh, I could do that, but I'm just gonna do this instead". And that is now rest, instead of thinking it the other way around, where work is life and those other opportunities, like hanging with friends or just doing other things weren't, you know, the offshoot. Instead, that's my actual life, and then work is sort of compartmentalized or partitioned. I think that definitely helps me in my mindset when I'm working and starting as well. It helps with preventing distractions and things like that.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

I would say maybe mid-thirties? I don't think I ever exceeded a 40 hour work week. Actually - sorry, I'm really bad at like, internally logging this kind of stuff. Because I think my...I don't know how unique my situation is, but I either work a lot and just grind, or I don't do a lot. So then it can become hard to average it out. So I'm struggling on quantifying that as an average, but...I think, yeah, definitely upwards of mid-thirties to maybe even hitting low forties for a work schedule.  

But I think the difference - and now that I'm reflecting on it out loud, because I was previously working during this past semester that I had off at a job at a company - I definitely feel like what I described earlier with having that clear distinction between work and not work made it feel like I was doing more work at school. Even if I count the numerical amount of time or I quantify the amount of time I spent doing schoolwork, just because school never felt like it was ending. I think it just felt like it was more work, even if it maybe wasn't actually more hours, but it just felt that way. Does that make sense?  

**That makes sense.**  

Okay.  

**And then during that busiest semester, whenever that was, what was the average number of rest hours you got per week?**  

I would say I think the same. So not including sleep, I would say maybe a little less than 10 hours. Yeah.  

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

In a single week? Um, probably I'm gonna say like 50. Another ballpark figure, but somewhere in that range.  

**Okay. Can you walk me through that week?**  

Sure. I don't remember the specifics, I think it was this past fall. It was just one of your classic school weeks where you just have EECS projects stacked on top of exams coming up soon. So it was just a back to back to back sprint of doing the project, "Okay, now I gotta study" and then I take the exam and then I gotta prepare for the next exam and then do the other work I have assigned with that. So it was all just a lot of, like, very rapid, no breathing space for a day where I can just not do anything and chill out. 

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**   

I mean like realistically, or I guess in a pragmatic sense I have full control. But I will mention that I definitely suffer from time blindness a lot of the time when I'm like super engrossed in a task. And then like I really dislike disrupting my flow and breaking my focus. Especially when CS work a lot of the time inherently involves really high levels of focus and concentration. So it makes me a lot more vulnerable to spending a lot more time than I would've liked to, especially if I'm mulling it over now. I will also say that my case again might be a little bit more different, because about a year and a half ago I was diagnosed with ADHD. So that's why there's a bit of a discrepancy there, and it's definitely the reason why I have my erratic work schedule where I'm super engrossed in something and other times I'm, like, very not attuned to whatever I should be working on. Maybe that would prevent me from having a more regular work schedule. I can also go in depth over any explanations that you need over the symptoms, I guess just the generic rundown, but yeah.

**That would probably be worth including, so go ahead.**  

Yeah. So I guess the simplest way to describe it is just literally a deficit in attention. I think the really common misconception - that I think I have as well - it's not that you can't focus on things. It's very common that people with ADHD can get really absorbed in some particular hobby that they might have. It's just that you're not able to control when that attention is being given. So obviously there are some things that might be more interesting to everyone, might be more motivating for them to focus on and work on, and...I think that's another hard thing is that everyone has those times where you are unable to focus on things and you're unable to concentrate on things that should be important to you and you should theoretically be able to put your mind on.  

At least for me, I've had a lot of times in my life where I've been unable to focus on things that have a really big importance to me. Or so I thought at least. And so there's a lot of situations where I rationalized it by saying "I must not care about this because I'm unable to focus on this thing", when in reality it's just, you know, my brain chemicals. <laugh> Like dopamine - but we don't need to go there. I think that's the simplest way I can put it. There's also the stereotype of hyperactivity, which is not always the case. It's very common that you have people with ADD, which is attention deficit disorder - you just don't have the hyperactivity.

So it's definitely a spectrum where you have some people that are like the stereotype, and then other people that maybe are really good at seeming like they're paying attention, but they're not there at all. Like they're not present mentally, cause they're off drifting away. Um, yeah. I know that since you have your own topics you wanna discuss about, I don't wanna go too in detail about it; but if you want me to, I can definitely go more in depth. But since I know that you wanna talk about imposter syndrome and that sort of stuff, I can keep it light for now. but I can elaborate more in detail if you'd like.  

**Is it safe to say that this will come up when we're discussing imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Yeah, definitely. I don't think I can get away with not talking about it, if I'm being truthful about it. 

**Okay. Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Definitely. I think when I first came to university, there was a lot of interest at first that then sort of died down, 'cause reality sort of sets in. I would say that in high school, I was never really a super academically oriented person. But recently in the last year, coincidentally, after my diagnosis and I started taking medication and I'm properly like, thinking about or introspecting over my life and um, just everything - I've definitely found myself taking a lot more of an interest in my academics. Not just doing what the grade requires of me, but also the intellectual application of it and why it's being taught and how it fits into a larger context. 

I think when I first came to the university, I was a little more inclined on average because a lot of my friends and people I knew were really concerned about just getting the A. You know, everyone talks about this, how we go on Atlas, you check the grade average, and people say "This class is a free pass". And I think just the fact that I decided to major in something like psychology that I just thought was cool and interesting, I think is definitely a big indicator that I was also - you know, I understand that that's a very important thing as well. But I think there was always some drive there to look at things and enjoy the academic pursuit of certain subjects. But yeah.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Um, yes. Again, it's kind of hard because again, my years were so different. I think when I first came to the university, I would say I was higher energy. Then I sort of went down, and recently it's gone up again. But I wouldn't say there's been...it's just been life, you know. I wouldn't attribute it to university, just other conditions.  

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

I would say no. Again, as I mentioned before, in high school I was not an overachiever by any means. In fact, I feel like...I actually got off the waitlist. I kind of feel like I was an underachiever, and I was very worried about living up to my potential. That's coincidentally another classic ADHD thing, because people feel like they're not achieving what they feel like they can be. When I first came to university, I think I had that first big desire to do all this stuff. But I very quickly found myself overwhelmed and then settling back into more of a healthy - or I guess maybe not healthy, but more of a medium, where I was trying to balance that better. Yeah, I would say, there's some variance depending on certain semesters. But yeah.

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Good question. So I think that's definitely one of my problem areas that I could definitely improve upon. I'm definitely a top down thinker: I like thinking of things or approaching them in very abstract terms, which is kind of weird for people who are supposed to be in CS because it's nice to be able to have that bottom-up approach all the time. But that manifests in me sometimes having goals that aren't really thought out. Particularly, I don't have a step-by-step plan of how I'm gonna achieve this goal. I'm definitely more of the "journey over destination" guy, so I'm content with just saying "I wanna do these things and I don't know how I'm gonna get there, but this is something I wanna eventually accomplish". And then to your second part about how often I accomplish them...yeah, again, I don't really explicitly set long-term goals very often, but I would say that for the most part, I think I'm pretty good about accomplishing them. Which is why I don't do it very often, which I think is also a bad thing. Because sometimes it's good to have goals that are a bit of a stretch and you're gonna get pushed out of your comfort zone a bit. 

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

I would say I was definitely above average, but I wouldn't - again, my high school had a lot of smart people, so I wouldn't say...I guess it's all relative. At my high school, I didn't feel like I was cream of the crop material there. I knew, or felt like I was an above-average student, but I don't know. I just felt like, again, like sort of an unreached potential, at least academically.

Like I got the stupid national merit PSAT test score. I don't know. Again, maybe nationally that's very impressive. I'm probably underplaying it too much, but at the time I was like, "Oh, this is cool. I don't really care about it." Like standardized tests, I was getting scores that every UofM student has to get. Very highly ranked national percentile scores. But you know, everyone else - and my friends at school, a lot of people were getting these same kinds of scores, if not better. So it kind of felt hard to celebrate those accomplishments when everyone else was doing the same.  

**Do you or did you ever feel pressured to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Uh, no. I'm gonna go back to my time at high school, because I was just surrounded by really talented and motivated peers. Then also just the fact that I didn't think of myself as, er, didn't have that drive to really achieve and reach those higher heights. I'm sorry, what was the question again? I just blanked.

Right, yeah. So no, I think because I didn't really like comparing myself to my peers, and I kind of saw it as a losing battle and I didn't want to constantly fight myself to achieve higher scores and things like that. And my parents weren't very demanding, and they always left me to pursue my own desires and never really pushed me that hard in academics. They would still want me to succeed, but I think that sort of combination never gave me that external motivation to be superhuman in high school. I think that definitely carried over to when I came to Michigan also, partly because my social network got carried over as well and I'm still surrounded by the same peers. So I wouldn't change that system that I had in high school.

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

<laugh> Love it. I love it. It's something I've become very used to and I've grown to appreciate. I think it's, um, it's a good teacher. It helps you figure out where you can improve, where something's not working. It's a very, very valuable part of college, and I think if you don't fail something in college, you're not doing college right. I think everyone says this, but it's a super important lesson. Then I guess my personal relationship with it was, um...I think because again, of that underlived or underused potential that I felt on myself, I was very used to feeling like I must have failed, because I'm not reaching my full potential. That definitely carried over to Michigan, and I definitely think it prevented me - like some past failures prevented me from really appreciating successes that I would have later on because of those past failures. 

I think it wasn't until I had really bad failures that really pushed me to try and change for the better. I think the failures I had growing up, before I got to college, were of the scope that was like, "Oh, damn, that sucks". But it's not like a really, really bad failure, you know? And I think those are the most valuable ones, because then you can really sit back and figure out...there's a stupid, uh, Avatar quote. [The interviewee here references an animated series titled "Avatar: The Last Airbender", not the live-action James Cameron movie that some readers may be more familiar with] I think Aang says this...I'm trying to remember. I don't know if you've seen that show, Legend of Korra. 

**I have not.**

Okay. Well I think the quote goes something like this. "Only when you are in your darkest place can you experience the greatest change." Eh? I might be misquoting it horribly. But I think that stuck with me, because personally, yeah, I think when you have a lot of that failure, then it's like...at the time it sucks, but looking back, it really showed the flaws in my current life or just approach to it or external circumstances.  

I'm like, "Okay, I need to do something about this", and I think it's such a valuable thing that everyone should go through. Well, I'm not saying everyone should fail everything or go through some bad times, but it's not something that people should be afraid of. Yeah. So I'm very grateful for it. And that's, I guess, my current relationship. I'm sure I'll have many more failures in the future.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?** 

Um, I get embarrassed. <laugh> I don't know. I stopped really holding much weight in any academic praise I think after like, elementary school. Mostly because I think things got harder, and it's not that I wasn't doing well. It's just that again, everyone else is getting similar accomplishments. So relative to my personal identity, it felt like less of a, you know, personal milestone. Also just based on the fact that it takes a certain kind of person to be able to excel in academics and have that sort of wiring to consistently find success. 

There's nothing wrong with that, but I think as I've gotten older, I just realize now that some people are just like that, and I think it's helped me come to terms with some of my past academic failures, but also to rationalize my own successes and realize that, um, it's all relative. It's not really saying much about what I value or what I think is important to success. Obviously I will always respect and celebrate other people's successes, but it's become less, I think, of a defining trait to me in the sense that there's other things, at least at our age, that people can be successful at. And growing up I think is probably the big thing, I think.  

And maybe that's my personal experience with where I grew up.

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Uh, I feel elated, like a small burst of joy. Sometimes I think the smaller successes are the ones that I can think of and remember how I felt; it's kind of hard to appreciate the longer term successes, like longitudinal things that I've put into place; it's harder for me to feel that internal sense of joy that I might get from something smaller. Yeah. It just feels good, you know, I'm not really thinking, I guess, too deeply about how - like I'm not the kind of person to like, jerk themselves off after I finally get something done. Like I don't think I'm the kind of person to mull over my accomplishments, like "I did that so well" or something like that. It feels nice. I celebrate. That's cool. That's it. Sorry you have to transcribe me saying that.

**No, there's worse. Don't worry. <laugh>**

**Anyway, how do you think others react when you succeed?**  

So I will say that I've never felt super gratified by external validation of my success. For example, high school graduation: big milestone, my parents invited my whole family, because, you know, it's a big milestone in my life, definitely something that'd be worth celebrating. But I never felt super excited about it, like, "Wow, I really did that". It just sort of happened.  

Maybe that stems from, again, me feeling like I didn't reach my full potential in high school. But past that example too, there's been lots of times where people have said "That's really cool, Otter, that's something you should celebrate!", but...I don't know. I think maybe that also comes from the fact that a lot of my most memorable successes are things that I've accomplished from some internal, you know, goal or desire. I feel like I can really grasp what went into it and that only I can. I'm not saying that only I can really appreciate someone's success or my success, but I think because you have that perspective, right? You're the one that went through it? So I guess at the end of the day, only you can really fully understand what had to be done to achieve that. That's my view. 

**Okay.**

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Um, I would say burning out is...I think two facets of it...no, I guess both of them are the same, right? Like you've depleted some resource, and that resource is very necessary for you to be able to do whatever you're burned out of. But to put it in less esoteric terms, you are losing sight of something. Either it's motivation - for me, it's a motivational thing, where maybe you're losing your drive or motivation to do something, whatever that might be. And then there's also, I guess, the burnout where, say, some people understand why something's important and they might have that sort of motivation, but there might be some external factors preventing them from reaching there. And I think that's more of, like, a physical burnout. That could come from overworking yourself - a classic example. So yeah.  

**Okay. Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define that in your words?**  

The key distinction that I always think of that was explained to me was this: someone is qualified for something, but they believe that they aren't. They feel like a cuckoo bird in a nest, but they're actually a regular bird.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yes.  

**Could you describe an experience or some of your experiences with burnout?**  

Yeah. So fall 2021, or was it 2020? My junior fall. Time's not important. COVID started that fall semester, and that was definitely my biggest burnout. I think this kind of goes hand in hand with my undiagnosed ADHD, but before COVID I was very dependent on external factors creating fear and, um, additional motivation for me to complete my tasks. So a classic example that everyone can relate to is just not doing your work, stressing out over the deadline, and then pushing to reach that deadline. Another way I sort of supplemented that was working in friend groups or socially, where if I'm working in project groups or with other people, that additional peer pressure would be another resource I could use to get myself to do work. And then come COVID, I'm locked in my room. <laugh> I don't really have anyone else I can reach out to.  

And I tried to, like - it's weird to study in a Discord call with someone, not really the same experience for what I was trying to replicate. And I really struggled a lot. It was very detrimental to my motivation, not even thinking about the other physical aspects of just being stuck in your room all the time and how that would compound it. It was really hard for me to wake up, turn on my computer, go to a lecture - I already didn't really go to lectures before that. Um, it was just very difficult for me to stay disciplined with my work. And it was very hard for me to focus online. I mean, I'm pretty sure there's studies. I don't wanna say anything cause I wanna double check that, but online learning is not really the same. We as humans don't get the same value out of a video call that we might get from face-to-face interaction.  

There's so much nuance that's being lost there, and that's just another, you know. It just builds and builds and builds, you know? And that, along with the fact that I was also still a little bit pissed off about the honor code thing, which made me retake a class - that all just sort of mashed together. And then there was a point during that semester where I was like, I just can't do this anymore. It got to the point where I had reached that, you know, exhaustion, and I just lost sight of things. Like "Do I even care about CS anymore? Like what, like what's - like, fuck school. Yeah, I was just completely burnt out. I just did not want to work, I didn't wanna study. 

After a certain point, all my assignments just weren't being done. I will also say though that I didn't communicate or reach out to as many people as I should have about the situation, in terms of just my professors and, um, other things. But I think maybe that wouldn't be appropriate either, just because I felt like it was a result of so many other things. It wasn't just a semester problem, it was just like a lot. Like a long time ago, maybe this started, and then it just builds up to that point. So it feels very hard to talk to a professor and ask "I need another week for this assignment", because who knows if it'll go away in a week? Or if you're still gonna be dealing with it?  

I guess it felt like the options I had weren't matching up to addressing the issue. I think the only way it could have been solved was just by burning out and realizing "This isn't working now, this is gonna fail". I think that's also cool too - I think there's a lot of things that have a natural self-healing aspect to them, where if things get bad enough, it'll self-correct. And I think burnout is definitely one mechanism like that. It's definitely an important part of our...like, I think avoiding burnout is not realistic. There's only one real way to test your limits, and that's by burning out and realizing that something you're doing isn't right. I don't think there's a single person that can manage that perfectly. <laugh> It just doesn't seem human to me. And yeah, after that burnout, I just was so burnt out of it and it was affecting other things. It basically culminated in me dropping that semester and getting a diagnosis and talking to my parents about it and realizing that I need to do something about this. 

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Mm, yes. And I can elaborate. I always used to joke that I don't have imposter syndrome because of that one nuance I mentioned earlier, that you have to be qualified in order to technically be feeling imposter syndrome. Because if you add another layer to it, that you're not qualified, then you're not an imposter; you, I guess - what is the level after imposter? I don't know. But you don't even...you have an imposter syndrome of imposter syndrome. <laugh> Like having imposter syndrome would imply that you are qualified, but if you're not actually qualified, then you can't have imposter syndrome, right?  

So that was a little joke that I always told myself. But yeah, I think I probably experienced it in high school. If I zoom back a lot, I felt like I was not achieving as much as my peers and that sort of displayed itself in me underachieving in high school. I think in college, it definitely was addressed to an extent in, you know, the whole burnout situation. But yeah, by the time I had reached that point, I think I was just more concerned with other things in my life than I was reflecting about "Oh, this peer is doing so much better than me". If I was thinking about that, I would've been thinking probably more about internships and things like that the prior two years.  

I think that's when I felt the most imposter syndrome. But yeah, I would say as I've matured more - it's not a maturity thing, but I think just for me...well, comparing yourself to your peers is nice. It's always good to have some external motivation, and having those external factors can be very helpful for your own growth and journey in life. What I always think of is like running in a race: sometimes you just need that person in front of you to push past your limit and, you know, try and get that extra time shaved off your personal record. And then other times, you have moments where no one else can really appreciate some things other than yourself. I think having that realization was very important for me, understanding that yeah, it's sometimes good to compare yourself to your peers, but a lot of times it's not really useful information.  

There's just so many factors that aren't really being captured by just a simple comparison like "This person is doing better in a class than me" or "This person has a job", or something like that. So yeah. I guess going back to a little bit about the success. I definitely feel like for me, the way I define success is when you have those external and internal factors combined. Like that would be the ideal state: you know, everyone's congratulating you for it and you feel like internally you matched up. 'cause there's a lot of times where I think there's successes where you feel like you did really well or something, but other people can't recognize or really understand that; and other times, you might feel like you didn't do crazy hot on something, but other people are like "Wow, that's so cool, really impressive", but for you it might be like a more regular occurrence. So I think for me, the best success is when you have the two in alignment. 

**Okay. How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**    

I think it's very prevalent. I think it goes hand in hand with sort of the culture that's built up, of going to like a top academic school. You have all these people that come to the university and feel that this is like, a huge opportunity, a big thing that you've done in your life, just getting here. And that only the sky's the limit. I think there's also the work-hard play-hard mentality that, um, is kind of birthed by the party culture as well. <laugh> Maybe it's a chicken and egg situation, I don't know. So I think that creates the perfect storm for students. I think also my perspective might be biased by the fact that I'm in CS, which is definitely a more rigorous discipline than some other fields.  

That's my personal outlook on it. And since again, a lot of my peers are in CS, firsthand I'm just seeing the struggles that they're going through relative to maybe what other peers are going through. I can think of a lot of examples of my friends overworking themselves and...I don't think I've really ever seen them personally go through a really bad burnout, because sometimes I think it can be a more private matter, as it was for me. But I think it's hard to really get a sense of how bad their burnouts can be, but I definitely see all the warning signs in some of my friends. I think because it's ingrained in the culture that I'm used to, it's passed over or just treated like, like it's just fine.  

And sometimes it's bigger than just, say, someone not managing their time properly. Like one of my friends was pre-med and is now actually in med school, which is super impressive - I lived with him and I saw the hell that he went through to get to where he is now. And at that time, it was just mindboggling to me the amount of stress and work and time that he spent to just climb that mountain. Um, and, and I think when you see people that are going through - or at least when you perceive that they're putting themselves under a lot more stress or burden than you think you are, it then kind of...I mean, at least for me, it sort of made my struggles feel less significant. That's never a good thing. Everyone has their own struggles and journey that you can't compare so easily, and I think at least for me, that was another important nugget of wisdom that helped me reduce my own burnouts when I would look at my friends going through a lot more stress than I felt like I was putting myself in. That's not really answering your question, but yeah, I would say very prevalent, at least within my circle.  

**Do you believe any of your peers have experienced imposter syndrome? And if so, how prevalent do you believe that is?**  

Um, that's tricky. Hmm...I know some of my peers have, and I know some that I'm maybe more uncertain of. But I think because I have some friends that are really smart and really talented, I've never seen a lot of them outwardly express it. I'm sure they have though, like I'm certain that everyone at this school has. It's just that there's varying extents that I guess reflect how much they feel about it.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Um, a lot. <laugh> I think just from my own personal story that I just said, but I think in the sense that for me to experience it and then go through it more deeply that it's helped me, I guess, understand it for myself; but it was hard. I don't think in experiencing burnout, I was able to see other people going through burnout. Probably because I was occupied with my own. But it was more of a personal discovery type of thing than me during the pandemic seeing my peers go through that kind of stuff. 

**Considering everything we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

Yeah, I do. A quick tidbit - I stopped psych because I wasn't finding it as interesting anymore, and that was the thing I enjoyed most during my early years. But I think my job and just getting to interact with computer science in different ways and getting new forms of exposure have really heightened my appreciation and interest for the subject matter. And definitely not what I would've anticipated when I first said I wanted to do CS. I would be lying if I said I hate the work I did. I do enjoy it. Obviously I don't know...the extent. I love this stuff, you know, but can I work on this stuff the rest of my life? I think I could, and that's enough for me. I'm not someone who codes personal projects for fun. I'll do it for interest sometimes, or if I'm working on something that I think is an important thing, 'cause if you can do that, you're set for life to code. But I don't hate coding. I enjoy it.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before 10 UofM?**  

Um, imposter syndrome, not very. Burnout, not very either. I guess I was aware of the dangers of overworking yourself, but not in the sense that I was actively looking out for it.

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

Um, it's gonna be a long four years. It's also gonna be a very fun and enjoyable four years. Everyone has their own journey, and we're all gonna get there in the end. So don't feel like you have to do something extra to get there, because you will get there.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say?**  

Yeah, send me the link to the website when it's up and out! I'm interested in checking it out.  

**Alright. Well I think that wraps up our interview, so thank you for interviewing; I'll stop the recording here.**  

Okay, yeah. Thanks for having me.
