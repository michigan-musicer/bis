**As a warmup, tell me a little bit about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Yeah. So in all of my primary education, I was homeschooled. Undergrad was like the first "real" school I went to. I was in liberal arts for two years, and then I switched to computer science in my last two years. And there, I basically tried to cram a bunch of computer science classes into a two-year period. I would've liked to have gone for a dual degree in math and computer science, but I only had time for computer science. So that was mainly my undergrad - trying to get everything done as fast as I could. 

**What prompted you to switch from liberal arts to computer science?**

For me, the main thing was that my professors didn't like my writing style and I didn't really like their writing style. So I didn't think it would be a good fit to keep working with them. And I had just taken a computer science class as a gen-ed, and I decided I liked the computer science class way more than my liberal arts classes. So I just switched over to computer science the next semester. I thought, "I like writing, I like computer science, but the writing I'm not really gonna get much out of." I think that's the main reason I switched.  

**Okay. How many years were you in your major?**  

When I graduated my undergrad, I was in it for two years. And now I've been in it for four years. 

**This might be a repeat of a previous question, but what is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

So it was sort of like I mentioned. I basically decided that I didn't really like my prospects in the liberal arts school 'cause I didn't really like the kind of writing that I would be learning about. So I was considering a bunch of different majors for a while, and I originally considered being a business major, but I decided it wasn't for me. And I just happened to take a computer science class because I thought it'd be easy, because I had already done programming in high school. So I thought it would just be a really straightforward class to take. So I took it, it was a lot of fun, and I just decided to keep doing it.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I would consider most people in the graduate school or in the last couple years of their undergrad my peers. But for people I work with - I guess that definition of peers - I'd probably include most of the people in my department.  

**Okay. Do you have an approximate number on that?**  

Oh, I would say that I probably have like 10 or 20 close peers, people I've actually worked with. And I would consider - I don't know how many people are in the department, but the rest of those would be my peers in a cooperative sense, I guess.  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

Well, we were in a group project and somebody didn't really put in some work, and some other group member wanted to, like, penalize them, I guess, for not working on it? So they set up this whole thing with the professor, and the professor was going to interview us about who worked on stuff. And I tried to settle it outside, because I didn't want to create a ton of drama. I wanted to do research with this professor, and I was worried that if we made this big issue for them, they wouldn't wanna be my advisor. 

The other most memorable thing is I have to take a hardware course for my degree, even though I don't study hardware. So I took this circuit testing class. It was like the hardest class that I've taken in a while just because I'm not super familiar with hardware at all. And the professor was totally expecting you to already know a lot of stuff about computer hardware.  

**What is the average number of hours you've worked per week in an average semester?**  

Um, that's a good question, because I don't time it...I would say almost certainly more than 40 hours a week, because I work more than 40 hours a week now during the summer, and I feel like I have much more free time during the summer than I did during the semester. I would wanna say 60 hours or more, but I don't know - that's just a guess. I know at a certain point, I was spending at least three hours a day just doing reading and stuff like that. And that was three hours a day, most days a week. 

So if I had to guess, I'd say 60 hours or somewhere around there.  

**Okay. What is the average number of rest hours you got in an average semester per week?**  

Well, it's a good question. So I'd spend maybe an hour to two hours going to the gym and stuff every day. So I guess that could technically count as rest hours. And then I'd spend maybe an hour or so, maybe two hours breakfast, lunch and dinner, just hanging out because I'd take a break. So maybe I'd say four hours a day, which is gonna be 28 hours a week.  

Yeah, a lot of it wasn't huge structured time. It was more of, "I'm eating lunch, so I'm gonna take a little bit longer or something like that".  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**

Oh yeah, that was my first semester. At that point I had three classes and I had two jobs. I don't know exactly how many hours I worked. I know I got like on average, maybe four to five hours of sleep a night.  

Um, I don't know. I would guess around 80 or more, but that's just a guess. It was hell though. So I never did it again.

**For that semester, what was the average amount of rest hours you got per week?**

I'd say maybe 10 or something like that, because more or less it was like, I would get up, I would work, and when I was done working, I would go to bed. As soon as I got up, I'd start working again. There were some issues where I was, I was so stressed and so overworked and drinking so much coffee that I actually had this issue with like, grinding teeth. I broke some teeth that semester...so I had to deal with that. So I took time off during the day to go to the dentist and stuff like that, but I wouldn't really consider that rest.

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**

I don't know the exact time, but I do know that during finals week of my second semester here, I think I slept an average of like one or two hours a night for a few days. And the rest of the time was just spent studying, because I really needed to pass my hardware course. So I don't know, whatever 24 times 7 minus like 14 hours is. [This comes out to 154 hours.]  

**Okay. How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

Well, I feel like I've a lot of control over when I do what. It's more that I have a high volume of stuff I need to do. I enjoy that I have lots of control over when I do what, but I feel like I have very little control over what necessarily I need to do. Sometimes I have control, like during my research I get to choose more or less what I do; but sometimes during the semester I'll say "Okay, I need to set aside three days to study probability theory", or something like that. In that regard there isn't much choice.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**

Yeah, at the beginning of every semester I'm really, really enthusiastic about a new class. I'm really excited about it and I wanna work on it all the time, but at the end of the semester I just don't wanna do anything. Cause I'm sort of burned out from the specific topic. I'm not necessarily burned out overall - I think by the end of the semester, there's so much that's built up on so much other stuff that I just wanna start over and not have all this accumulated stuff I need to work on. 'cause by the end of the semester, you have to remember back to what you did at the beginning to do homework problems, but when you start a new semester, you sort of start fresh. 

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

I don't think so. I think I've become a little bit more cynical, but I don't think I've become less enthusiastic about what I do.

I think I've become a little bit disillusioned with the ratio of science to bureaucracy in academia and the importance of reputation. But other than that, I feel more or less the same.  

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**

Um, no. I mean, my grad school GPA is higher than my undergrad GPA, but I think that's probably because of the grade inflation that happens in grad school. And then partially because I didn't do especially well during the first half of my undergrad - I didn't do poorly, but I did significantly better once I switched from liberal arts to computer science. So the first half of my transcript during my undergrad is not as good as the second half. That kinda pulled it down a bit.  

**Okay. Shifting gears a bit - when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Oh, my goals. So <laugh>, my goals are very unrealistic. And usually I don't really accomplish them all the way. I just sort of get going into a useful direction, but I don't necessarily finish my goals. So for example, if it's a research project, then yeah, I'll complete it. If it's schoolwork I'll complete it. But if it's something like - you know, I have this book that I've wanted to read for a while and I keep planning time to read it, but I always underestimate how much effort it's going to take. So I typically just run out of time and don't get to them.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yeah. I mean, I almost graduated summa cum laude, but I missed it because of non-computer science classes. I think it was my liberal arts classes and my foreign language classes that brought me down? I would consider myself maybe average here in like the graduate school, but at my undergrad, I would've considered myself one of the better students. But I don't know if that's - I'm not saying it's because I was smarter. Maybe I was just more motivated or something. But I felt like there were only a couple students in my school who I could get help from, and most of the time I was helping somebody else.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Maybe. It depends on your definition of superhuman, mainly. I feel like I just have an issue keeping up with everybody else, I guess. Sometimes I feel pressure to perform as well as some of the people who are famous. who have seminal papers or something like that. I guess in that case, you could say that I feel pressured to be superhuman, because as a master's student I feel like I need to live up to, uh, what's his name? Shannon or someone like that. But I don't feel like I've been told I need to do something impossible. It's more that sometimes I'm worried if I have the capacity to do the work I have to do. But I feel that's standard in the field.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**

Um...Yeah, I'm not a big fan of it. I generally try to avoid it. I actually wanted to drop out of the computer science program here during my first semester, because during my first semester I got my first C on a homework assignment. So I thought I was not qualified, and I thought I should just drop out and save myself the embarrassment of getting kicked out. But I decided that I was gonna take the approach that even if I think I suck, I'm gonna wait till somebody else tells me that, instead of telling myself that. So I kind of just kept working on stuff anyway and it basically always turns out fine. That's the mentality I try to take now - even if I think what I'm doing is bad, I'm gonna wait until somebody else tells me that before I give up. Or I'm gonna wait until somebody kicks me out instead of giving up.

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

Um, generally I try to - you said specifically academic, right? - yeah, generally I try to, um, make them not say that. For a couple reasons: one, if I get too much praise, I get kind of arrogant, so I wanna avoid that. But then also, I feel like people misunderstand my academic performance to being especially smart or being especially skilled - but I think really I just put lots and lots of time into it.  

So I don't really like getting academic praise. Obviously I don't want people to tell me that I'm stupid, but I don't especially like it if people praise me for what I'm doing either.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Usually it's like, "Well, I could have done that better" or something like that. Obviously I'm happy when I succeed, but usually I'm sure that I could have done it much better and I just didn't. So after I finish something, I'm thinking about how I could've done it better and maybe how I would do it better next time.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I think for the most part, people are supportive. I haven't met anybody who's unsupportive of it. I don't participate in many competitions, like official competitions, so I don't know. Maybe if there was actually a competition environment, people would be less supportive. But I haven't really met anyone who wasn't supportive.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?** 

Yes.

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

I would say it's a point where you - well, okay. I would say to be burned out, you have to have been enthusiastic at some point in the past. Otherwise you just hate it and it's not burnout. So I'd say burnout is a point where you do something so much or so intensely for an extended period of time that you don't want to do it at all. And you are very unmotivated to work on it and you kind of try to avoid it if you can.  

It's also, it's sort of like you have this sort of - you get depressed about a lot of things. Not just the thing that you're burned out about. You feel like that's sort of a negative sign for your future or this thing that you put a lot of time into. Because if you don't like this thing anymore, then all this time you put into it is kind of wasted.

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**

Mm-hmm.

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

I would say imposter syndrome is when you feel like people are not aware of how incapable you are, whether that's true or not. And you feel like the position you're in is because of some sort of accident or some lapse in somebody else's judgment, rather than your skill or abilities.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yeah. Well I haven't experienced it to the point where I couldn't come back from it, but I've gotten very close to getting to the point where I just didn't wanna work on stuff anymore. Or like, I didn't want to work on a specific subject ever because I did it too much. Sometimes at the end of a semester I'll get to the point where I just don't wanna have anything to do with that topic anymore, and usually it'll go away after a couple weeks, but it'll get to this weird point where I don't wanna work on the topic and I feel kind of like - I feel like, sort of generally not super depressed, but generally slightly depressed about a lot of things. And then I'll start thinking about all sorts of stupid long term situations that could happen. Like "Oh no, I hate the subject, so I'm gonna have to quit school and I'm gonna have to go work at a retail store". Something like that. And this long chain of stupid reasoning. It usually goes away, and I know that it's pretty temporary, so I just ride it out.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah, all the time. But like I said, I usually just say, "If I'm bad then someone's gonna fire me eventually, they're not gonna let me stick around forever. So I'll just wait until that happens." I guess part of imposter syndrome is thinking that you know more about your performance than the people that you're working with do. So if you think that say, your professor made a mistake in hiring you, then you're sort of saying that you know more than your professor about what good research looks like. And that seems a bit arrogant, so I try to think about it that way. If my professor's been doing research for so many years and they're a successful researcher, then they're gonna know more than me about what good research looks like. So if I feel like I'm not producing, but they think I'm doing fine, then I should listen to them.  

**Are there any specific stories about burnout or imposter syndrome that you'd like to elaborate on?**  

Well, one of the professors that I work with - because I'm working with multiple professors currently - one of them is very concerned with the possibility that I'll burn out. I guess they think that I work too hard, so they tell me a lot to make sure that I take time off and stuff like that. That's actually been really helpful, because I didn't realize that I wanted to take time off until somebody told me that I should. So now I'm a little bit more careful about taking time to do things that I would like to do, even if they're not really constructive in a research or academic sense. But I do remember that after the end of my first semester here, I was very close to being burned out, and I do know it happened in my undergrad when I was trying to finish my degree. I think at one point I was taking like 21 credits or something like that. And I was taking multiple math courses at the same time; I would spontaneously get really emotional about stuff even though I was doing fine. So yeah, that was kind of a problem. I'm a little better at handling it now, 'cause it happens so many times I'm used to it.  

**Okay. How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

Well I think almost everybody experiences some temporary burnout. I've very infrequently met somebody who completely burned out and wasn't really able to do anything afterwards. I think maybe I know two or three people who did that; I'm not really sure what the difference is. I guess maybe when they temporarily burned out, they didn't take a break or something like that. But I don't think I've met anyone who's like permanently burned out - or I've met very few.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

People don't talk about it much, but I'm sure that at least like I'd say probably 25% to 75% of students experience imposter syndrome.

Yeah, I'd say maybe a quarter to three quarters of people experience it.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

Um. I guess maybe it made me a little bit more aware of it, because during undergrad, what I would do is if I was starting to feel burned out, I would sort of go out on the weekends  to make me forget that I felt really stressed. And I would get involved with drama so I wouldn't have - so I'd have something else to think about. But during COVID I couldn't really do that. So for a while I would just get really irritable. Then I think I sort of figured out how to handle it in a more constructive way, so I guess for me, maybe it was helpful because it stopped me from the cycle of, if I feel stressed, I go and party on the weekend as a release. So yeah.  

**Do you believe it had any impact with imposter syndrome?**

Well, I don't know if it's 'cause of COVID, but here I feel like much more of an imposter because - like I mentioned, in my other school, I was helping most other people and there weren't very many people that were helping me. But here it's sort of the other way; I feel like I'm asking everybody for help. So I feel like much more of an imposter here. I don't think it's related to COVID, although I guess COVID did make it a little bit worse in that I couldn't talk to any other students. I guess it seemed like everyone was kind of a genius who had no concerns at all because I couldn't hear anybody on Zoom. Like I couldn't talk to anybody, so that made it a little bit worse. I guess COVID did sort of make my imposter syndrome worse, and now that it's more or less over it's a little bit easier.  

**Close to wrapping up - considering everything that we've talked about today, do you and have you enjoyed your academic work?** 

Yeah, I've had fun. I think. I mean I only worked for a company for a little bit, so I couldn't say if I would've preferred it more, but I think I definitely have enjoyed my master's program and my undergrad program. It's funny, I feel like I've tried about as hard as I could, but I feel like if I were to get to do it again, I would try to try harder. <laugh> Which I don't know if I could, but this may just be me looking back on things. But I feel like there are a lot of things I could have done better if I knew about them ahead of time, so if I were to do it again, I could do it better; but I don't know. At that point, it's something you have to just say that you did the best that you could do. You're more or less happy with the way things turned out, 'cause they're the best they could have turned out with the stuff you knew at the time.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

Yeah, I knew about them. I guess I didn't think about them too much. Like I knew about them from an intellectual standpoint, and I knew it was a thing that happened. I didn't really feel it too much, I guess. Although I guess people told me I would often undersell my work, so I guess in that sense I sort of experienced it, but didn't really think about it in that way.

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I don't think I would give myself any advice. I don't think I could've handled it any better than I did. And I'm not saying I did it perfectly, but - well, two things, one I don't think I would listen to me! I think I would do what I did anyway. And then also I don't think I have great advice either. 

**Is there anything else you'd like to say?**  

Nope. You're right on the money with 45 minutes.  

**Yep.**
