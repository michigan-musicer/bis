**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

Prior to UofM - so I went to a high school in Michigan, and it's supposedly one of the feeder schools to UofM. I think the school prepared me pretty well for most of the undergraduate education here,  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**

20. Do you want me to define peers?  

**You can, yeah.**  

Okay. Yeah. So peers, the term is kind of the people who work on similar projects that I do, because the work that I do is very specialized. You have to understand both AI and also some domain knowledge, right? Not a lot of people can actually do that. So mostly people in my cohort, plus a few people in the computer science PhD program. That's most of it.

**And the count is for right now?**  

Yeah, right now.  

**So then would you say similar counts for your undergrad and master's?**

Undergrad is different because your knowledge is a lot less focused on a specific area of your research. Say you're on a project team: pretty much all of these count as your peers, right? You're working on different subtasks of the big problem. So undergrad, you definitely have a lot more peers that basically understand the things that you work on and can help you contribute or collaborate with you. But as you go deeper in your education, through your master's and PhD, this group of people become smaller and smaller.  

**How many years have you been in your major?**  

Uh, this is technically only one year in my major.

**How about for master's and undergrad?**  

Six years.  

**Okay, 4-2 split?**  

Yeah, 4-2. I didn't have to do four, but that's kind of how it turned out.  

**Okay. What is the story of you deciding on your major in undergrad and continuing on to grad school?**  

I've always known that I wanted to do CS. I don't know why, but I guess someday I just knew that I wanted to do CS. <laugh> You know, a lot of conversation with parents because they offered some of their guidance as well, obviously. That's kind of how I decided on the major.  

And then the decision on the master's is because of research, because the research I did, I really enjoy doing that. So master's is kind of like, uh, you have a buffer zone to decide whether you want to keep working on the research or if you just want to go to the industry. At the end, I met my current advisor, who turned out to be great. I really enjoy working with him. That's basically why I'm doing a PhD. Some people jokingly asked me earlier, "If your advisor disappeared right now, what would you do?" I would say more likely than not, I'd probably quit the program.  

**Hmm. Okay.**  

**What is your most memorable story about academics from all of your time at UofM?**  

My most memorable story about academics...let's see. It's a very broad question.  

**If you wanna just pick some memorable experiences, that's also fine.**  

Yeah, so since most of my master's and a lot of the PhD was online, a lot of the good moments are in undergrad. I guess one of the most memorable times was pulling an all-nighter in my major design class. That was the first all-nighter that I've ever done; 60 or 70% of the class were really behind on this project that we were working on then, so a lot of us were in the lab - it was autonomous robotics major design - so a lot of us were in the lab pretty much the night before the party was due. It was an experience...it turned out okay at the end, but at that time I did not enjoy that. Yeah. Looking back at it, it's a good experience. There was a lot of teamwork being involved, some slackers, but yeah. That was senior year undergrad.  

**Alright. This is gonna be a doozy because you have three degrees under your belt or in progress - but what is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester, for all three of your degrees?**  

So...let's go from now to the beginning. So right now, probably 70, I shoot for 70 hours. More realistically, it's gonna be closer to 60 or maybe 55. They're mostly allocated to research; because of the projects that I work on, I spend a lot of time in the lab that's not on the computer. I spend this amount of time on coding, on experiments, and the things that I need to get done, and I also spend a lot of time in the lab that's basically not coding, so there's a pretty good split I'd say. I probably spend at least 10 hours or so in the lab that's not just on my desk. That takes a decent amount of time, but - I think a lot of people kind of don't enjoy doing non-technical work, but I still think it's a good experience that grounds you in the context of the work that you do.   

So going back: in master's, I shot for 80 hours, because master's is a very trying time, at least for me. It was the COVID time, but that's fine, you stay home the whole time. I shot for 80 hours because it's 20 hours teaching, because I was a GSI, and then 20 hours for research, because at the time, uh - I did a lot less research, or I spent a lot less time working on it at least - and then 40 hours on coursework. It usually turned out to be 70 hours, more like 20 or 30 on classes. Classes aren't that challenging for the most part. So that's kind of how master's went, and then in undergrad, it kind of varies. I would say probably 60 to 70 hours a week is what I shot for for the most part, I believe. You do mostly focus on coursework. And I did some research that involved 15 to 20 hours per week during the school year. Late undergrad - early undergrad is all coursework.

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester? When I say waking rest hours, I mean time that you're taking to relax during the day.**  

Not a lot. I tend to take naps, like short naps, during the day, so that takes up more time than anything. Then usually I probably spend an hour or two on food, and at the same time I watch YouTube or something on TVs. Let's say one to three hours per day, probably.  

**Okay, does that go for all three periods?**  

Uh, that's true for master's and PhD. I probably had more time to do random things during undergrad. So in undergrad, you take a lot of classes that are not your major. They're pretty much just, like, not real academic work, right? So it's not...they're not "work", but I wouldn't say they're leisure time either. But I also spent a lot more time on commute during undergrad, so you're traveling a lot. That's also a big factor.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**  

Busiest single semester or busiest time in a semester?  

**Uh, busiest single semester.**  

Okay. Um, I think they're all about the same. I tend to push myself pretty hard in terms of registering and signing up for things, so all semesters are probably equally busy, I would say. If I have more time, I'll do research. So I think they're all about the same, the quantities I said earlier.  

**And should I also assume that waking rest hours is similar as well?**  

Yeah.  

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

Single week...I've definitely done 80. Maybe, um, 85. I don't think I've ever done more than that.  

**Could you walk me through that week or an example of one of those weeks?**

As in a day-to-day or just a composition breakdown?  

**Uh, you can do either one.**  

Okay. I guess I'll do a composition breakdown 'cause that's probably easier. So for these semesters, probably I guess most of these days will be...so sleeping time will be for each day for a lot of these weeks, and - for now, in a precandidate lifestyle, you would spend a lot of time working on, say there's a homework due or say there's a project due, so you'll spend a decent amount of time on coursework and things like that. I will typically drop research for some of those weeks. You can't drop research for like a month, right? But you can drop it for a week, and if you have a good advisor, then they will understand. So I would say the majority of the time on that week will be spent on coursework. Then teaching is not something you can drop, so you will still have to do a lot of teaching, just because it's a very big collaborative, uh, environment. Like people are counting on the stuff that you're working on. 

I would say I was probably the busiest during master's, so a typical 80 hour week will probably come from that period. If that makes sense - I feel like that was not very coherent.  

**I'm sure it'll make sense once it's transcribed.**  

<laugh> 

**How much control do you feel had over how you spent your time, across all periods?**  

How much control over how I spent my time?...I have pretty good control over it. The composition of the time, that's different, because you have to prioritize some tasks over others. That's why the composition is not really something - I mean, maybe beginning of the semester, I can choose to work on this over the other thing; but the way I work, basically at the end of the year, there'll be some deadlines approaching and you'll be doing that for a week and you'll drop other things for a week, and then you'll catch up on these other tasks later. So I have a pretty good grasp on how much time I spend on work, right? But what I do is not necessarily a choice.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

No. That has been the same.  

**Could you elaborate on that? Why you think it might have stayed the same?**  

So in high school, your goal is always to get into a college, right? At least the way I approached it, once you get into college, your goal has been trying to either get a job or get an internship - so get a job or get into grad school, right? That hasn't really changed. So you have a goal in mind that this is what I'm going for and everything I do is going to build toward achieving that goal, right? That's kind of why it hasn't really changed. At least in high school until now. It might change in the future, because you know, there's no more school after a PhD.  

**Did you have a change in your overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

I feel like it's going down, but whether it's actually going down, I don't know. I feel like I could do more. It's kind of the thought that like, back in the day I used to do this so well, and now, I wish I could do that better. Or I *would* do that better, but I don't have time for that, or I can't prioritize that right now. So at the end of the day, I wish, you know, I had more energy to do everything I wanted to do, but that's just not gonna happen.   

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

No. I suppose...so the first two years are easier in general. At least for me, I did really good in the first, say, two years or so. And then it got slightly worse because I was spending more time in research. A lot of the research, when you start, there's not necessarily any results coming out, so it's kind of a time sink sometimes. So results in terms of undergraduate grades, then, I suppose the grades slipped a little bit. They were fine at the end. Similar for master's. THen I mean, in a PhD coursework doesn't matter that much, so long as you pass that's good enough. So there's a progression in terms of difficulty and priority, right? It's getting harder, and classes are becoming less and less of a priority. So I'm not upset if I see lower grades now.  

**Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

There are different kinds of goals I set for myself. Some goals are like, "I'm going to finish implementing this thing by the end of the month", or "I'm going to finish these sets of experiments by the end of the month". These tend to be realistic, as in I can get them done, because that's how I set them, right? But there are also other kinds of goals that are kind of like, "Yeah, I'm going to accomplish this big thing by April this year", right? Or if I want to submit to this conference at this time. That doesn't tend to always happen, because well, science. Your experiments are not always going to work. So if at the end things just don't work out, then they don't work out. You shouldn't try to force it. So, you know, have I missed deadlines? Definitely. But I think I'm okay with that.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

I was okay. I was pretty good. I was pretty good at what I did. Not necessarily best - I never really think it's very meaningful to always go for best, especially if you're looking at a relatively small cohort. So I don't think I was ever best at anything, but I was pretty good all around before coming to UofM.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

No. People say when you're coming to UofM, you're - you used to be a big fish in a small pond, right? Now you have all big fishes in UofM. So there's no expectation or pressure to perform. So there's that. I was pretty happy that I did okay.

**Okay.**  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

It happens pretty often, I'd say. It's not something you look for, but you're not really surprised if you see it.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?** 

Usually say I got lucky or something like that. I mean, I don't care much for it. It's okay.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Pretty good. I mean, accomplishing something that you've been trying to do is obviously a good feeling. You're pretty happy with the work. So that's good.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**

Others as in peers, as defined earlier? They're usually supportive, so they'll be happy.  

**Okay. Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

Basically you stay focused on working on one thing for so long, and then you get stressed about it. And at the end, your productivity goes down, and you become less interested in what you were working on. Basically, you lose the sense of why you started to work on it in the first place.

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

So imposter syndrome is basically, um, you feel like you don't deserve everything you have accomplished and that you are basically faking it until someone else, uh, figures out that you're fake. And you're worried that that's gonna happen to you pretty much any time.  

**Do you believe you've experienced burnout?**

Mm-hmm.  

**How so?**  

So a lot of times...it's like you kept getting negative results, right? So it's that kind of feeling that you've been working really hard towards something, and you just keep getting negative results. Sometimes you work *really* hard. You basically - again, this is kind of the way I work: I would drop everything else to work on one thing at a time, right? So you dropped everything else - dropped as in stopped working on it and not as in dropping classes. So you'll drop it for a week and you'll keep working on one project for a long time, and then at the end you keep getting negative results. And you start to lose focus and you start to hate the thing that you're doing, and you almost feel like you're losing hope. So experiences like that; and at the end, it's just like, "I don't really wanna work on this anymore. Why am I doing this in the first place?"

**Do you believe you've experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yeah. Sometimes these two go hand-in-hand, right? In research, this happens pretty frequently. You can't get any good results and then you think, "You know, I never have any good ideas anymore, and I don't think I'll make it to the end of the semester", right? For example, in a class, say you propose a project for the final project, or you worked on a research project or on a project team. You just kinda think, "I don't have any good ideas after this anymore, I don't think I'll make it", you know? It's feelings like that.  

**How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I don't think it's super high. At least, my department is actually a lot better than computer science, I believe, in terms of burnout and things like that. I think most of my peers understand how to balance their time to have a balance in terms of work and not working on things. So I don't think a huge percentage of my peers experienced burnout, at least not right now.  

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

I think that's more frequent. I'll say the majority, probably more than the majority, experience imposter syndrome.  

**And just to go back to those two questions: do you believe that is different for undergrad and master's? Or do you believe that you saw something different?**  

Yeah, definitely. You get more burnout in undergrad for sure, and more imposter syndrome as you get higher in your education.  

**Okay.**  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?** 

I think awareness is about the same, because I've heard of these terms before. In our undergraduate education in CSE, a lot of these ideas are taught to us in our classes, so I was aware of both. COVID-19 didn't really increase or decrease my awareness. But for my experience, I experienced more burnout and similar imposter syndrome as before.  

**Alright, close to closing: considering everything we've talked about, do you and have you enjoyed your academic work?**

Yes. I definitely would still do it, knowing this - I mean, I knew these things were going to happen like halfway through. But if I had known about these things, I would definitely do them again.   

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I did not know about them. Never heard of these terms before.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you began at UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

I was given some pretty good advice about imposter syndrome and burnout. Like the fish thing is definitely helpful. So, um, don't get used to being the best at everything, because that doesn't really happen here at UofM. Maybe you can be best at something, but definitely not everything. A lot of times, doing your best is good enough.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

No, I think it's pretty self-explanatory to me, most of the things I said.  

**Alright. In that case, thank you for your participation, and I will stop the interview here.**
