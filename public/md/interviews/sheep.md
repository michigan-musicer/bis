**As a warmup, tell me a little about your education prior to coming to UofM.**  

I got my bachelor's in computer engineering and then came straight here. It's the end of my third year here.  

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

I would say 10 to 15 on the basis that I know more than just who they are, and I would actually go talk to them about stuff.  

**How many years have you been in your major for both graduate and undergrad?**  

Four undergrad, three grad.  

**Okay, and what is the story of you deciding on your major in undergrad and continuing it into grad school?**  

I was exposed to computer science really early on, and it turned out to be a natural fit. Very much liked it and yeah, pretty straightforward for me to be honest. <laugh>  

**Alright. What is your most memorable academic story from your time at UofM?**  

Hmm. I got a funny one that I'm not gonna say...I'm gonna think of a second one. Okay, so we were working on a class project for mobile, and suffice to say, neither of us had really any idea what we were doing at the beginning. We were looking at obscure pieces of code that we've never interacted with, and when that finally worked, it kind of felt magical to be honest. <laugh> That was really cool.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in an average semester?**  

Hard to say, but I'm gonna go ahead and just say 40.  

**What is the average number of waking rest hours you got per week in an average semester? Waking rest being time you take off during the day.**  

Okay, waking rest...call it about five hours a day on the weekday. And then I don't know, 10 hours on the weekend. So five times five is 25, plus 20 is 45.  

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was.**  

Hmm, I'm gonna say 40 again.  

**Interesting. So then are you implying a pretty low variance here between semesters then?** 

Yep.

**Is there a reason or story behind that? Just out of curiosity.**  

So at least in my time at UofM, which I assume is the scope, it's mostly been that no matter the classes, no matter the research, there's always, you know, more research that can be done anyways. So it was less about freeing up time and more - like, having more of it to classes and less of it to research, then moving all of it on research. But it all evens out. Deadlines are harder, non-deadlines are easier. I mean, some of the semesters when there were courses may have been harder, but I think time wise, you end up getting to a certain limit that you can't handle anymore than that. <laugh>  

**And then for that busiest semester, I would assume same number of rest hours too?**  

Yeah. I don't think there's been too much variance either way over the whole semester. I mean, of course there's weeks where there's more, but as a whole, I would say yeah.  

**Okay. Relevant question here: what is the most number of hours you worked in a single week?**  

I've never counted, but I suspect I've got up to 70 or 80 once.  

**Hmm. Can you walk me through that or an example of one of those weeks?**  

Oh, I got a whole bunch of them! Pretty much any week before the paper is due. Particularly the ones that we were behind, which was most of them. <laugh> It's just a matter of...you're taking all your compute, which in my case is split up on GPUs, and trying to pipeline everything so that everything is running 24/7 every single day, so you get it done as early as possible. I mean, it's pretty much just that you gotta just knock things off as quick as you can. Because your list is longer than 40 hour weeks will let you, once you get down to a week or two away,  

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**

A lot. I mostly just have to be at meetings, which I have more than the average student I hear, but it's not nearly enough to be that big of a hamper or anything. I do try to get work done in regular hours - to varying degrees of success - but yeah, I generally have pretty good flexibility.  

**Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, I mean on the whole - I was talking about this with other people, like a lot of PhD students will tell you in my experience...in the very near term, we hate X, Y, and Z. And you ask them "Well, how do you feel about the whole experience?" it becomes "Oh yeah. I love the PhD". <laugh> So it's this weird dichotomy of, well, once you understand everything that goes in it and how hard it is, then yeah; there'll be times where you feel perhaps less motivated. But on the whole, when you take a step back at it, I still see it as a very rewarding thing. Certainly not as easy as I may have thought, certainly not as smooth as I may have thought, certainly harder to push through than I thought. But still, as a whole, still a very good experience.  

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah. I entered kind of wanting to prove to everybody I belong, and I had this giddy enthusiasm that everyone picked up on. And you know, five paper rejections later, maybe not the same level of enthusiasm. So it's dropped off a little bit.  

I think most people will tell you that it gets hard, and you know, it certainly has been. And sometimes you're just like, "Well, I don't know when it's gonna break through, I don't know how it's gonna break through, I don't know how we're gonna get through it". But you just find a way to do it. But yeah, that almost naivete of "We're just gonna come in and set the world on fire and just do everything and it's gonna be smooth: - that kind of goes away after a little bit of practice. <laugh>  

**Did you have a change in the overall trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Grade-wise, no, classes were fine. In terms of research deliverables, papers have gotten better, in that first two years I only had rejects and I finally had an accept this year. So it's gotten better in that regard. In terms of smaller things, like nailing little presentations or whatever, those have been pretty constant. So I'd say it's been pretty pretty even. Again, depends how you define success too.    

**Okay. Shifting gears a bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

Ah! So when it comes to something I have to promise to somebody, super conservative. When it comes to setting my internal goals for the week, itâ€™s usually on the ambitious side, and it ends up taking a little bit longer than I think, usually.  

Unless it's deadline week, then you just make it happen. <laugh>  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

I would say so, yeah.  

**How so?**  

Um, well I had an extremely high GPA for one. I was always really strong in classes. I was always, you know, good at being able to explain things to others. I was doing well in internships, I was doing well in research. So yeah, I'd say it went pretty well.  

**Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Hmm. I would say it's nuanced. There's not an expectation to be the absolute best in the world or anything like that, but in terms of the speed of success, there are times where something that seems realistic at the surface turns out to be harder. And in that sense a little bit, but I think it just comes down to the fact it's really, really hard to regulate what is a normal output. I think what we often consider as a normal output, be it from myself or from others, tends to err on the side of optimistic. So perhaps not superhuman, but fairly high expectations. And it's just a matter of trying to maximize the time here, I think.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

I like to avoid it as much as possible. I like to prepare for everything in advance so that if it happens, I know how to immediately react to it. But I've had a lot of experience with it in grad school, just between paper rejections - which are normal, but you know, you still have to deal with it - between ideas not working, between research being research essentially. <laugh> So it's something that now is just kind of accepted as part of normal life. I try to still avoid it as much as I can, but when it happens, it's, well, par for the course here.  

I was once told that if you're not failing often in the PhD, you're not trying hard enough. So I kind of understand where that's coming from. As much as I'd rather avoid it, I would still rather swing for the fences and fail than do nothing and not fail.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I hang onto it. Not because I wanna think of myself so highly, but more sort of...it's just nice to feel appreciated and recognized for what you've done, but it also helps you through times when things are not going as well, to remember, "Hey, this is just part of the downs, but overall things have been pretty good. Like we've been doing good work here." So it's nice to remember those things, because it's not always going to go well. You're gonna have ups and downs, so you wanna remember the ups to carry through the downs. But I mean, of course human nature - it is nice to take it even on the spot of course. That's the longer view.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

Happy of course. Feels like, you know, you can recognize that your effort finally paid off. It gives you validation that you belong here and that you're doing what you should be doing...also just brings relief of, you know, you finally got over whatever you're trying to get over. You don't have to work on that hill again, you can move on to a new one - which is exciting.   

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I have a really good support system, and they're well aware of when things are not going well, I'll tell you that. So when things do go well, people are extremely, extremely happy for me. Yeah.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?** 

Yes. 

**How would you define burnout in your own words?**  

I would say that burnout is when you've overworked yourself for a long enough period of time that your mental capacity, your energy capacity, just your ability to function kind of goes down. Your motivation goes down, and it's a factor of, essentially - you're not a machine. And once you burn out your fuel, if you got no more fuel to go, then it's just not good. <laugh> 

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yes.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

I would define imposter syndrome as this overarching feeling that you don't truly belong where you are, that you're not good enough, that you somehow lucked into being where you are, that you don't deserve to be there anymore. Yeah.  

**Do you believe you've ever experienced burnout?**  

Yes. Now burnout can be in different stages. I've debated over the years how severe or not severe it's been, but one example I can give you of this is working in deadline crunch mode for four weeks for a paper, 'cause we were really trying to rush it.

The next two or three months, productivity was much, much, much lower than usual. And yeah, oftentimes there are good things to choose from in a PhD, such as additional projects that are good, and it's very easy to take on more than you can handle. After balancing it for long enough - give it a couple months, give it half a year, give it a year - then at some point it's just a lot, and you need a break and reset.

**Do you believe you've ever experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Yes. And I would say that I would be surprised if nearly anybody said no confidently and immediately with a straight face. There was one class I had in undergrad where the computer science professor asked everybody to close their eyes and raise their hands if they'd ever felt imposter syndrome. And he said in all his years of running the experiment, only two people have ever not raised their hand.

**Do you have any specific experiences that you're willing to share?**  

I would say vaguely that...let's just say I've had a lot of things going my way to get to where I am. I was gifted a pretty good situation. When that's the case, you really feel like you wanna maximize the hand that you were given. And if the hand you were given was very good, I think you naturally expect to then be very good. But sometimes that's just not the way it works out. So I think that's kind of the general way that has played out for me.  

**I see. How prevalent do you believe burnout is among your peers?**  

I'd say it's pretty prevalent, at least in minor forms. I would say perhaps not everyone would say they had it, but I'd say a lot of people could at least relate to minor forms of it.

**How prevalent do you believe imposter syndrome is among your peers?**  

Um, very much so. At least from time to time; I don't think it's something that most people dwell on most of the time, per se. I think most people felt it at some point in time or another.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

I think it has made it worse in that there was less opportunity to self-regulate norms with other students. So your tendency to possibly overwork yourself would be higher because you cannot talk to other students and understand what is realistic. You don't have the ability to have a trusted labmate tell you, "Hey, you need to take a break".  

**Close to closing off: considering everything that we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

I do. It's definitely hard, and there are times where I'm not sure what I'm doing here. But overall, this absolutely feels like this is the right path. I knew it was gonna be hard, I did get something hard, but ultimately that's what makes it rewarding.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM?**  

I was very aware of imposter syndrome. I, uh, was fairly aware of burnout the concept, but less so the specifics of it and the severity scale that it runs.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**

That everyone around you is feeling it. You just gotta ask, you gotta talk to people. You gotta understand. It's not just you. I've been told by profs that it never goes away, and that's kind of a comforting feeling. <laugh> Yeah. Talk to people.  

**Is there anything else you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

I don't think so. I think that's good.  

**Alright, short and sweet. Thank you for your participation and I'll stop the recording here.**
