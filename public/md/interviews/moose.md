**Alright. To warm up, tell me a little bit about your education prior to coming to UofM.**

Starting with eighth grade I went to a youth program for academically talented students, and it was really just extra classes at a nearby university taught by professors. All I did was algebra one and two in the same year - it was the only thing that program was, really. So I got into high school with algebra one and two already done. 

Then I went to a different magnet school program for STEM. What you're supposed to do when you get in, is most of your non-math and science classes you take at a normal public high school, and then you take all your math and science classes, like biology, like calculus, et cetera, all at the magnet. So half the day you go to your main high school, and half the day you go to the other high school. So I did that all four years of high school.

**Approximately how many people do you count as your peers at UofM, whatever peers might mean to you?**  

Peers...I haven't personally used the word peers ever! How many people...let's see. Probably 20 for people that I actually talk to on a regular basis while I'm on campus. I don't think it's much bigger than that, I don't talk to that many people. Obviously I have a lot of acquaintances, especially once I started taking language learning classes last year - which by the way, I would recommend, that's probably been one of the best ways I've met new people and found good relationships. So yeah.  

**How many years have you been in your major?**  

I declared last year. Wait, no, I declared sophomore year, I think towards the end of sophomore year. What I understood was that that was the deadline for declaring your major. So I was like, "Oh yeah, I should probably declare". I probably could have declared way earlier, but I just did it towards the end of sophomore year.  

**What is the story of you deciding on your major?**  

I guess I only ever had two different things I was interested in when I was in elementary school. I was interested in astronomy because I thought telescopes and seeing stuff really far away and stars and stuff seemed really cool. Then once I got into fifth grade and started learning coding on my own - because I wanted to mod Minecraft - after that I was like, "Yeah, I think I wanna do CS as a job" 'cause I thought it was pretty cool, even though it was also really frustrating. So yeah, ever since then, I've pretty much always been set on doing computer science.  

**Okay. What is your most memorable story about academics from your time at UofM?**  

At UofM? At the moment it's from the class EECS 490, programming languages. It's most memorable since it happened last semester? I took that class last semester, I had a vacation over spring break, and my vacation went all the way until the last day of spring break. Then I had an exam for 490 the day after that, and my impression of the exam was it wouldn't be very hard, because I felt that the homeworks and basically everything about the class was not very hard for me. So I only ended up taking one practice exam, and I didn't really take it in a normal exam setting because I was assuming this was gonna be one of my easier exams. And then I ended up doing absolutely terrible on that exam. So that's probably the most memorable thing - still managed a B+ in the class. That's the highest I could have possibly gotten with how bad I did on the midterm, so I'm proud of that.  

**What is the average number of hours you have worked per week in an average semester?**  

Okay. Average...that's a good question. I've never been very organized about keeping track of my time, so it's a bit hard to guess. But I know if I wanna try to quantify it still, Japanese would take an average of an hour every day, I think that's pretty consistent. Especially if you include weekends, then it balances out on weekdays - it was sometimes a bit longer than an hour. Then you add in CS classes, and I think for project based classes, usually I would do most of the projects over the course of just a couple days, just really long work sessions. Except for EECS 482, that was completely different. So those are 10 hours for multiple days. 

It's really hard to say, I would guess probably over 20 hours, maybe 30 hours a week? But that's like probably a bit above average. It's hard to really find an average; I wish I actually recorded it so I could tell you for sure. But yeah, CS projects and that stuff often takes a while, so yeah.  

**Okay. What's the average number of rest hours you got in an average week for an average semester?**  

For most semesters I was pretty good about sleep. I think I usually got seven or eight hours.  

**What about getting rest when you're awake?**  

Getting rest when you're awake? If I consider video gaming to be rest, I think it kind of is for me, then probably I would probably spend a minimum of an hour every day playing a game. That was pretty much what I did, because I felt like games put me in a better mood, and if I was in a better mood, I could get more work done. Some days I would do more than an hour, but it was usually a minimum of an hour.   

**So then would I count that as seven hours of rest per week?**  

Um, probably more like 15.  

**15. Okay.**

**What is the average number of hours you worked per week in your busiest semester, whenever that was?**

That's a good question. That probably is...No, it was definitely this one semester. So I had a semester where I took math 217 plus EECS 281 plus EECS 370 plus EECS 285. In this semester I would regularly spend probably about 20 hours a week on math outside of class. And then every week I would have at least one project, which took an average of 15 to 20 hours. So I was pretty consistently working on that pretty much the entire semester. <laugh> So if you add that, that's, um - I can't keep track of numbers right now - but that was definitely the most busy semester.  

Like 30 to 40. Yeah. And it was consistent throughout the entire semester. A lot of other semesters you'd have that much work for one week, but then the next week you'd have it pretty light; but that one was a pretty consistently heavy semester.  

And I knew I was getting into that, and honestly I really enjoy coding projects - I mean, most of my work is coding projects. I actually enjoy it. 

**What's your average amount of rest hours during that busiest semester, per week?**  

Um, let's see...so one thing I know: Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I would always spend an hour after my math class playing computer games with my roommate. So it's at least probably five hours, and then some weekends I had less work, so you probably add 10 hours. It's probably about 10 at least.  

I pretty consistently play video games at all times, regardless of how busy I am. Sometimes I lose sleep for it...it's whatever. <laugh>  

**What is the most number of hours you've worked in a single week?**  

Hmm, let's see. For me, if I'm working a ton of hours, it's usually because I'm really engaged. I've never really had that I simultaneously really don't feel like working and I also have a ton of work to do. Usually once I get into the huge amount of work to do, I get really engaged. I think it's one of the reasons why I'm a good student, is that regardless of the subject, I can almost always start enjoying it once I've started putting tons and tons of time into it, 'cause usually there's so many different parts to it. So that's why it's a little bit hard for me to remember that. So probably the most time I've ever worked in a week - one thing I can think of is the last week of last semester was pretty bad for me, because I think I didn't play any games for a week straight because I was basically working 24/7, because I just had so many different things to catch up on.  

I first had a Japanese final project, which was a video recording of myself playing music. And then I had a final presentation for tech-comm. Then I also had the exam for EECS 490 that I wanted to get the very best possible grades on, since I was already doing poorly in that class. So altogether I probably had zero rest time that week, and I probably spent the entire week working at all waking hours. I don't really know how much you can quantify the amount of work actually done there. It's probably like 50 hours minimum, right? No rest time, so that kind of gives you a lot more time.  

**How much control do you feel you have over how you spend your time?**  

I feel I have a pretty decent amount of control, and it's mostly because CS classes, even though they take a ton of time, they also usually have very little actual in-class time. So you get a lot of time, but you also have to spend most of that time doing work, but it's pretty flexible where you put that time. So if I wanted to - and sometimes I did - I would play some games in the morning, spend the rest of the day working. More often I would spend the morning, afternoon and a lot of the night working, and then I played games the last couple hours before I sleep. So it felt like because I got to decide when I work, even though I have a lot of work, it felt like I usually had a good amount of flexibility in college.  

**Okay. Did you have a change in enthusiasm for academic work since you began attending UofM?**  

That's a good question. Specifically math, I actually started to like math a lot more once I took math 217, so positive there. CS honestly stayed about the same. The whole time I already was kind of used to, from my magnet school, doing very large amounts of work and being busy for an entire week and doing stuff like that. So none of that had the ability to change how I viewed things that much. I had been coding for so long, since I was in fifth grade, so there wasn't really anything coding classes could throw at me that I wasn't already expecting. Overall I don't think there was any huge change in enthusiasm for much at all. Besides, like I said, I kind of started to enjoy math a bit more. Mostly once I started to understand how you can prove stuff - that's kinda why I'm more interested in math, 'cause proofs are actually pretty cool.

**Did you have a change in overall energy level since you began attending UofM?**   

Lemme try to remember what I was like in high school...I mean, I think I've been pretty consistent. I think I've always divided my energy between games and side projects and school, and I've pretty much stayed consistent that way. You can see, if you were to look through my files on my computer, you could see consistent work on side projects starting from freshman year of high school going all the way until now - this past month, I think I spent 40 hours working on a project just for the fun of it. I think I've always had a pretty consistent energy level in those ways.  

**Did you have a change in the trend of your academic results since you began attending UofM?**  

Yeah, I think it was mostly the pandemic. My first semester I actually did quite well. Well actually, I felt like my first couple semesters, I didn't have many friends, and so it was easy to spend all my time on academics, and then I got really good grades. Then the pandemic happened and even though I had more friends now, I still was able to spend all my time on academics. So it was fine just because you don't spend any time commuting, you never meet with anyone in-person, you can do work while you're talking to people on Discord or whatever. So I was pretty consistent in being very good at doing lots of work all the time. But once the pandemic ended and we were back in person, I found my first B+ and then my second B+ this last semester. I think overall, besides the fact that there were some things I didn't like about those classes that gave me a B+...  

I think I also dropped my work ethic a bit since the pandemic ended. I think it's actually somewhat justifiable. I'm spending more time actually hanging out with people, especially with meeting people through my language class. So in a way, and I talk to my brother a lot about this, it's not really worth it to spend your entire college experience just working to get that 4.0. It's probably better to take a few hits, but actually meet and build relationships with a lot more people. So I don't necessarily regret my drop in work ethic by a bit. I think it's probably worth it.  

**Shifting gears a little bit: when you set goals for yourself, how realistic are they and how consistently can you accomplish them?**  

I think my goals are a lot more realistic than they used to be. I guess setting goals for myself in CS stuff...first of all, I'm mostly gonna talk about side projects when talking about setting goals. You could say I also set goals for taking exams and everything, and I also try to be pretty realistic there; but most of my experience with setting goals and seeing what I can accomplish is in side projects. When I was in elementary school, I started trying to do some game development, and I had really big goals. But once you actually start trying to figure out how to code and make stuff, you start to realize just how hard it is to create something. So from there I started already tempering my expectations.  

Once I started getting better at coding in early to mid-middle school, I started to make my goals pretty realistic. Basically I would write out a list of five features that I want to implement in this game, and my current goal is only to implement this one feature. And I started iterating over this a lot. At some point I started having a whole concept of a minimum viable product, which is a very real thing in the software engineering world - I sort of came to that concept on my own a bit. Basically I always try to continue doing that where you just - because it actually takes an emotional toll on you if you try to dream up a huge big goal for a side project and you barely get any of it done. That's really disappointing and you don't wanna have to disappoint yourself that often. 

So I try to temper my goals, but I still set them high enough because I do have a good amount of faith in myself in what I can accomplish. Like my current side project. Once I get back into a working mood, which - right now I'm out of it because every time I switch cities, like I've just done again, it takes a week for me to start being in the mindset where I can actually just spend all my time coding again. I think I'll be able to accomplish that within the next few months, and if I can accomplish my current goal, I think it'll look really good on a resume. But yeah, I think if I try to think of the last goal that I failed to reach, it probably is one of my projects in high school where I did set my goals way too high. But that was also a really stressful time in my high school career, so it was hard to actually follow through with anything at that point in time. So yeah, I think I'm pretty good at setting goals.  

**In your education before UofM, were you ever a best or an especially strong student?**  

Yeah, doing that advanced program and then going to a magnet school, I think I was basically put into that place. I also got a CS award at my magnet school, so I'm supposedly the best male CS person at my magnet school - there was a female and male award. But yeah, I think I was probably one of the best students. I think most people saw me that way, especially in CS class, because in CS class I sort of this smug person who doesn't pay that much attention in class, but when he does pay attention, he almost always like, raised his hand, "Oh yeah, here's a caveat on what you just said about Java", which was kind of funny. 

I tried to have a good relationship with the teacher; I was never trying to be antagonistic doing that. It oftentimes made CS class pretty fun, although I think, like, maybe you should also interview some of the other people in that class as to how I treated that situation. But I think in general, because I really tried hard in school and tried to get good at coding, I was usually one of the best students in those two fields in particular. In coding and maybe math, but mostly coding. There were some people who were definitely better than me at math.  

**Okay. Do you or have you ever felt pressure to be superhuman at UofM?**  

Let's see, superhuman...maybe sometimes I created that pressure for myself a bit. So when I took EECS 280, I blew off the projects a little bit. So I gave myself two days to do the euchre project, right? I actually ended up finishing it in seven hours still. So I sort of gave myself the standards to be superhuman, but then I also managed to achieve being superhuman. But the fact is I could have started that project way earlier and I wouldn't have needed to, so that's why I sort of see it as my fault that I ever set that kind of standard for myself. Because I know that in the long run, you can't expect yourself to always perform at your peak, and that's why you can't always do your project two nights before, even if you have a lot of confidence. So basically what I'm saying is, I think that it's very possible to put yourself in that situation, but I don't think it has been necessarily the college's fault.  

At least in my experience, I think someone who has to learn coding from scratch especially is gonna find themselves in that situation a lot more often, because there are a lot of times where I feel like the classes really did skip ahead. The fact was I already felt like I was that much farther ahead anyway, so it was fine to me. But I was friends with some people who were really struggling in those classes, especially math, EECS 376 - that class I think expected a lot of people to be superhuman. I tried my best to help them with studying and so on, but a lot of the time it was just too much to put on people who hadn't taken math 217 yet. So yeah, definitely taking math two 17 before 376 was a huge boost, and it was the reason why I did really well in 376, 'cause I think 376 was quite hard.  

**What is your relationship with failure?**  

Failure? I mean, last semester I definitely had failure with the EECS 490 exam, the midterm. That's what I keep thinking about with regards to failure. Then there was also the midterm for EECS 482 that I see as a failure. And then I felt like I was a failure for a while because I only got one internship offer. It took a few months before I ever got another offer, but then I got three offers at once, and then I realized maybe I was just unlucky for a bit. So maybe I wasn't a failure, but I definitely felt like I was a failure for a few months there. My relationship with failure is...well, I think there are a lot of parts of what I do that aren't always the greatest. Like sometimes I spend too much time gaming, and that can lead to failures. I don't think that failure is something that usually just happens to you. Usually it has a cause of some sort, but usually it's not simple at all. 

If you talk about why I did bad on the EECS 490 exam, it took me a month to really come up with anything somewhat coherent because - I was talking with an IA, when I was still struggling to form an opinion on what I had messed up so badly. And I feel like there were a lot of different factors, and usually failure is pretty complicated like that because there wasn't one single thing I did wrong. There were a lot of different parts to my mentality in that class for why I did poorly, and I think there were a lot of ways I wasn't prepared for the way that class was shaped as a whole. I'm guessing that's the way it is for a lot of people; I don't think that people usually have a single reason why they might fail a class. I think it is often pretty complicated. I hope that answers it a little bit.  

**How do you react to academic praise from others?**  

I think I react poorly. My first example at UofM was I was taking math 215, which is calculus three. I was sitting next to this person a lot like during lectures, and what she quickly noticed about me was when we would learn a new concept, I would usually get it really quickly, and she would take a while to get it. So she would praise me, like "Oh yeah, Moose, you're so smart, you're able to figure it out that fast". And for me, I have gotten compliments like that for a long time, and I still don't always know how to react. I just say thanks, because a lot of the time I feel kind of bad because they didn't get it, you know? And then I wonder how that makes them feel. But also, you have to say thank you, right? You have to accept people's compliments. You can't just brush it off, because that's kind of rude as well. 

I don't necessarily like being complimented that much because I always feel like it puts me in a weird position. But if you think about it, a lot of the time when you do something better than someone else, it kind of puts them in a weird position. So it almost makes sense that they would share it with you via a compliment. But yeah, it's just weird. I have kind of a weird relationship in general with how I see myself and my own skills versus how other people see theirs. 

For the longest time I had this belief that anyone could be as good as I am at what I do, especially with coding. Because I felt that the only reason I was as good at coding as I was, was because I spent a while learning from YouTube tutorials and trying to understand coding itself and then trying to go into other things. So I thought if anyone else watched over a hundred YouTube tutorials on how to code in Java, they could probably be just as good. But I started to learn that that mentality, especially in high school, is actually not that great for interacting with people, because it sort of says that other people could be as good as you, but just don't try hard enough. Or something like that. That's not a great thing.  

Obviously I've never said anything like that, but it's not uh, a great way to see it. Now that I displaced that belief, I still haven't fully formed a coherent way of seeing how I relate to others with talent and so on. It's kind of weird for me. I still don't always know how to handle praise. I usually try to acknowledge it, you know, and then, I don't usually...I don't know if you can have a conversation about that. It's weird.  

**What feelings do you have when you succeed?**  

When I succeed? Um, a lot of the time it's total indifference. A lot of people describe, especially with CS projects, they'll finish a project and be like, "Oh, I'm so glad it was done. I'm so proud, can you see this? This works." And I'm just usually like, "Meh, it works. Let's move on." <laugh> That's pretty much just the way I always see it. A lot of the time, I like the process of coding and I like to focus on a goal, but I don't feel particularly rewarded when I reach the goal. I guess the one exception to that is when it comes to game development and seeing other people play your game. If you see other people genuinely have a lot of fun playing a game that you made, then that actually is quite rewarding.  

Honestly the social aspect is probably the big way I actually feel positive results of what I do. Besides that, when thinking about feelings of reward after, like, accomplishing stuff - especially a year ago, I was thinking about this as a problem. I had gotten straight As for a whole year, but I honestly didn't care. It didn't make me feel good or anything, I was just like, "Yep. I did it. I reached my goal. Let's move on." It felt like I put in so much effort, but I just didn't feel any positive results of it. Like having a 4.0 GPA and then still struggling a bit with getting internships. So I was just like, "I don't even think that it matters that much, all this work I'm putting in". So yeah, it's kind of weird.  

**How do you think others react when you succeed?**  

I think a lot of the time, people expect me to succeed. It's kind of awkward sometimes talking to people who are taking EECS 281. I got a P in EECS 281 because I got a B+, and it was just because the final exam, I kind of had a mental boom - so I guess that's another failure, but I haven't really thought about that in a while. So seeing other people take the exam and do fine on it, they say, "Oh yeah, I'm sure you aced this exam". And I say, "Yeah, no, I actually got 60% on that exam". It's kind of weird. I feel like I have a lot of expectations from people to succeed, even at times when I definitely did not succeed.  

Especially in high school, this was a really common thing. There's this class called AP CS in high school, and there were a lot of parts outside of the main AP CS curriculum that we did that were relevant to computer science in general. For example, there was this cybersecurity online quiz that we were supposed to take, and if you did well in this quiz, then you'd go to some national competition for it. A lot of people told me they expected me to, like, "Oh yeah, you'd be really good at that stuff". And then I take the quiz and I do just as well as anyone else, just seven out of 40, because I don't know anything. I especially at that time didn't know anything in depth about RSA or SHA 256.  

But people would often expect me to know that. At this point, maybe I'm kind of used to - like I just have the voice in the back of my head that says, "Everyone's gonna expect me to do well here". But one thing that really helps me in comparison to I think a lot of people who might have a similar situation: a lot of people have that expectation coming from their parents and their family. But for me, my parents never expected me to do anything crazy. My parents basically just - like they aren't Asian parents. They don't expect you to do well and get a super good job. My dad dropped out of college and my mom got a degree in accounting, like a bachelor's degree, and kind of just did that for 20 years.  

So neither of them had super crazy academic outcomes, so they didn't expect any of me or my siblings to do very well in school at all. And they just tried to support us where we needed it, and they were continuously like, "We're really impressed by your grades". Like they tried to make it clear they didn't...they knew I didn't really like being praised that much, but they still tried to make me know that they're proud of me in different ways, which is cool. I think they did pretty well with that. So I think that's one way that I have a support system that doesn't necessarily expect me to succeed, and that helps a lot.  

**Have you heard the term burnout before?**  

Yeah. I think I dealt with burnout all the way back in third grade. <laugh> Because I was trying to learn to code as an elementary schooler, and I didn't have any guidance from any people. I had guidance from YouTube tutorials...I guess I wasn't really trying to learn to code, I was trying to learn to make a game in Adobe Flash by copy-pasting code from the internet. You start to feel like every single path you could take forward is going to cause failure, no matter what you do, and you just don't care anymore. And I felt that all the way back at third grade, and I got so angry and at some point just deleted the software off my computer and didn't pick it up again until fifth grade. I think that was really the first time I had burnout, but I continued to have it over and over again throughout all of middle and high school.  

So I got the ability from a young age to try and understand what burnout is and what my relationship is with it. I guess if we talk about other times that I burned out, we have in fifth grade - even though I did that thing where I spent a whole year watching a bunch of YouTube videos while learning coding, there were a lot of times where I would watch a ton of videos in one day and then not pick it up again for two weeks. I basically did that continuously, where I would watch a ton, but then I just didn't feel like doing it anymore and just didn't pick it up again. So eventually at some point I just think about it.  

I decide "You know what? That was kind of fun. We're gonna do that again." So that's kind of like burnout, but it's not really the same. You come back to middle school and I was trying to learn OpenGL at this point. Once again, I had the same issue as third grade where I was trying to continue to learn something that's really complicated, and there weren't good tutorials online for it. And I just got so frustrated over and over again and just had to quit. I think at one point I probably did quit for a whole year...but I always came back to it somehow. Then continuing in high school, I think there was a time where I really burned out over the summer between freshman and sophomore year. I got like super angry again, and this time it was because I was trying to do C++ OpenGL and I was trying to get the libraries to work and figure out how to compile it properly.  

I don't know if you've had to deal with this, but it can be such a huge pain to get dependencies to link. It was especially bad because I didn't understand and never found any resources about the difference between dynamic and static linking, which actually really matters if you're trying to figure out how to get your program to compile with external libraries. Like you have to know that, and I didn't know it. At some point I got something slightly working. I just used that for two years, that slightly working setup with a lot of warnings all over the place. But yeah, I think I put in multiple 10 hour days, and once I got something that finally worked a little bit, I didn't come back to it for a few months. So I think there were a lot of times where I got really angry and experienced a sort of burnout, but then it was gone.  

But this is all side project stuff. Once I started on my first internship, I was really excited and just went crazy with learning Angular, TypeScript, and just went really hard on learning stuff for a while. And then at some point I sort of hit a wall, and this was different from every other time. I had a different kind of burnout than a side project burnout; I guess the side project burnout is characterized by, you get frustrated at something and you just stop for a while, and then eventually you come back to it because there was a reason you were doing that side project in the first place. And if you really genuinely wanted to be doing it, you're probably gonna end up wanting to do it again in the future.  

But when it comes to burnout on a job, you get this thing where...you start to realize why there are so many memes online about how people work two hours a day and then kind of sit around and do nothing for the remainder of the day. It's like that a lot of the time when you have a lot of tasks, and sometimes you have a lot of tasks to do on your CS job, and it just doesn't feel like it's worth it. I guess a lot of the time, I don't think I was even able to fully describe what I felt - it just felt so hard to continue doing any work. There were a lot of times where I felt like that in my first internship.  

And there were a lot of different ways I saw it, but I honestly never fully figured it out. I think that was like burnout. And then I sort of had the same issue in my second internship, and that's when I really started having a bit of a mentality change with how I approach coding, when you just don't feel like doing anything. I don't know, you just try to have a little bit more fun with it than you used to. Instead of being full on serious mode all the time, trying to get stuff done, trying to be productive, you start being like, "Let's spend a lot of time learning documentation, just 'cause it'd be interesting and it's technically part of my job". You start doing a lot more stuff like that to try to combat the possibility that you're not gonna feel like doing anything if you work too hard right now.  

I think it's kind of a continuous thing that you face. Like in the moment when you're feeling burnt out a bit, you have to decide how you're gonna move forward and what kind of worker you wanna be. I think it kind of is natural to just not wanna do work, and you just have to try and understand what's going on. I think it is also specific to the situation. I don't know if you have any other opinions on how that works, but that's sort of my experience.  

**So in this case, how are you defining burnout personally?**  

Um, times when I really didn't wanna work for a long period of time. 

**Okay.**  

**Have you heard the term imposter syndrome or something similar before?**  

Yeah.  

**How would you define that in your own words?**  

I think there was a time where I thought I knew what it meant, but then I realized I was wrong when I looked it up. But I don't remember if I remember that definition...I'll still make an attempt. So it's basically when you feel like you're not good enough for the job that you're doing. Everyone around you is better, and then there's yourself, and you feel like - I guess you're an imposter in the sense that everyone thought you were good enough, like recruiters and so on, to be doing your current job, but you just aren't; and no matter what you do, you'll never be good enough. Usually stuff like that. It's probably characterized by a lot of thoughts of not good enough going through your head.  

**Okay.**  

**With what you talked about earlier, I assume you would say that you have experienced burnout.**  

Yeah. I think I've experienced burnout. I think that was my whole thing with my experiences about it, yes.  

**Do you believe you have experienced imposter syndrome?**  

Uh, I think there's one time where I can think of that probably came the closest to that imposter syndrome. In high school, there was a thing called ACSL, which is the American Computer Science League. What happens is you have a team of five people from your high school, and they send your team of five people to the national competition - which is actually an international competition, but it's called a national competition. Because teams from South Korea, Romania, and I think one other Eastern European country go there as well, but it's mostly national, mostly high schools from around the country. But so there's this competition that I went to twice.  

These two competitions, especially the last one was pretty memorable, because, uh, I was usually doing really well in tests and everything in CS class, so everyone expected me to carry the team. And then we get to the written portion of the ACSL test and I pretty much bomb it. Well, I was middle of the pack on my team, but my team also did really bad on that. I felt like they expected me to do a lot better, and I also felt in a lot of ways, since they hadn't been messing with this stuff - like they hadn't been doing computer science, you know, before they were a freshman in high school - they kind of deserved to be where they were with how much experience they had.  

Whereas I had this much more experience that I should have had, but I was doing the same. So I was kind of an imposter in terms of...like these people are clearly better than me as students, because they had this much less time and they still did the same as well. I thought, "Yeah, that really sucked". And then we got to the coding part, and there were times I remember during the coding part of the competition that I felt basically the exact same thing. Like "I don't know why this problem is so hard for me to solve", or, uh, I think there was one of those times where I felt like I've solved something like this before, but I just couldn't come to the solution then. And it once again made me feel like an imposter for the same reason, because all these people had so much less experience, then there's me with more experience, still failing.  

It was kind of embarrassing. But the thing is, I don't think I've experienced imposter syndrome in the general sense like a normal person would, who started computer science in freshman year of college and then is, you know, doing really well in all the classes; but then they get into the job and they don't know what they're doing. I can definitely understand the imposter syndrome feeling there, but I haven't had it personally. For me, I think the most important part about my experience trying to learn Java and OpenGL in middle school was I was basically spending a lot of time slowly getting into understanding documentation and starting to enjoy reading documentation more. Just spending everything I have on documentation.  

You start learning how to put yourself in a completely new coding environment and then working up from scratch, right? And I sort of learned how to do that and became a lot more confident when I relearned coding. It felt like when I learned C++, and then when I went ahead and also learned a bunch of other libraries - I started getting a lot better at taking new libraries from the internet and using them in my projects. Eventually I just got into reading documentation all the time, and I started to enjoy reading documentation a lot. So that's why I feel like it would be hard for me to feel imposter syndrome, because I feel like the life of a coder is being thrown into a new environment and spending hours reading documentation until you can feel confident again. I kind of expect that. But then I can see a lot of people, they get into a new environment and they see all the stuff they've never seen before; and it can just feel like, "Why am I here?" You can get how that would be the case. But for me, that's not the case, just because I'm kind of set up and prepared for that mentally. I don't know if that's a good answer, but that's what I got. <laugh>  

**Okay. Have you experienced burnout and/or imposter syndrome during your time at UofM?**  

I would say no.  

**How do you believe the COVID-19 pandemic has affected your awareness and experience with burnout and imposter syndrome?**  

I mean, it was easier for me to be more productive back during the pandemic because there was nothing to do. But I also don't think I really had issues with burnout in college. If you were to take a milder term than burnout, just struggling to do work, I would say for me, some amount of struggle to get the willpower to do work is normal for me. I'm sort of like, back and forth: "I don't feel like doing work", "Okay, let's do work for 10 hours straight", "I don't feel like doing work". That's a little bit normal for me. It's probably not always the healthiest, but I also wouldn't call it burnout just because of how normal it is for me. I'd say that that cycle was doing a lot better in the pandemic than outside of it, and that's why I was thinking that the pandemic being over and being back in-person actually made things harder for me. That's one of the factors in me doing a little bit worse than the last year.  

Overall, I don't think imposter syndrome and burnout are that relevant for me. I think you should save those terms for people who've had a lot worse problems that I've heard of with those things.  

**Starting to wrap up here: considering everything that we've talked about today, do you enjoy your academic work?**  

I do. I like coding, I think math is cool, um - I think it's definitely the career I wanna at least spend a lot of my life in and try to see where I can go with it. Yeah, I think overall I enjoy it.  

**How conscious were you about imposter syndrome and burnout before attending UofM? I assume since most of what you talked about was before UofM, uh...**  

I guess I wasn't aware of the term imposter syndrome before UofM. I think burnout is kind of a common thing, but imposter syndrome felt like it was a bit more of a "new age" term that didn't exist as much until I heard about it from people at UofM. So yeah, I think I still had the experience even without knowing the term, at ACSL.  

**If you could send a message to yourself back when you entered UofM, what advice, if any, would you give regarding imposter syndrome and burnout?**  

That's a good question. I mean, it's hard 'cause I feel like most of what I know about - like most of the advances I've made since the beginning of college, I only really got through experience. It's hard to condense anything to just a single message. I think overall, I've done pretty well in college. Most of the things I have regrets about are just people whose  contact info I should've gotten before the pandemic. I don't think I have that much to tell to myself, maybe just..."You're doing a good job, keep going forward, you'll make it". Especially my freshman year, I was feeling a little bit isolated when I first got to UofM and didn't know anyone. So maybe I needed to hear something like that.  

**Okay. Is there anything that you'd like to say in the context of this interview?**  

Not really. I'm curious about your opinions on this stuff, but obviously I'm the interviewee.  

**That wraps up the interview then. I'll stop the recording there.**
