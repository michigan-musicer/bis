*I am staying anonymous for two main reasons:* 

1. *If I am identified, it may risk the anonymity of the interviewees in this project.* 
2. *This project is about the message, not the messanger. I shouldn't be getting in the way of these stories.*

*If you have questions, please contact me at [thecourtmusician@gmail.com](mailto:thecourtmusician@gmail.com). Depending on what I want to do and depending on interviewee consent, I may deanonymize myself at a later date to claim this work.*
