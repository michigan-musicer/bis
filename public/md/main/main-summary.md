This project is a series of interviews collected from 41 current undergraduates, graduate students, and alumni from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor about their experiences with burnout and IS (imposter syndrome). This project was completed between the months of May and July of 2022.

The main purpose of *Brilliant Little Fires* is to provide personal stories about burnout and imposter syndrome, particularly for college students who may be struggling with these feelings. Burnout and imposter syndrome became more prominent topics in the news in light of the COVID-19 pandemic **CITE**, and psychology researchers are exploring both topics in the academic literature **CITE**. However, when I experienced these things, I had a hard time finding collections of personal stories that I could personally relate to. My hope is that this project can remedy that to some extent.

Because the main purpose of this project is to provide personal stories, I encourage you to [read at least one or two interviews](#interviews). I understand, though, that not everyone will have the time, so I've compiled [a shorter list of observations as well](#observations). 

This project is not officially affiliated with or endorsed in any way by the University of Michigan. This project is not a formal research study and should not be cited as such. Please view all results in context of [the methodology, described here](#methodology). In particular, **be aware that 1. observations are given solely by one person, me; and 2. interviewees are not representative of UofM as a whole, but rather skew towards heterosexual Asian / Caucasian men in engineering** ([see demographic info here](/observations_demographic_quantitative)).

In case you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, here is a list of UofM-specific resources plus resources general to the United States. You do not have to use these, but please know that they are available if you're in need.
