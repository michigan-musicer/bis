*11 observations are provided in an attempt to summarize the findings from this project. Because the main purpose of this project is to provide personal stories, I encourage you to read at least one or two interviews down below. I understand, though, that not everyone will have the time.* 

*All observations my own. I am not a mental health professional, nor am I specialized in psychology in any way or otherwise qualified to give medical advice. This resource is not intended to be a substitute for professional help.* 

*I encourage you to draw your own conclusions - in particular, if you are an expert in this area, please reach out and give me your opinion if you're interested!*
