*Above all else, my sincere thanks to everyone who shared their story with me. In hour-long conversations, you've taught me things I'd have taken years to learn on my own. I hope your words will help others too.*

*Inspiration for this project came from the* [Soft White Underbelly](https://www.youtube.com/c/SoftWhiteUnderbelly/featured) *video project by Mark Laita.* Soft White Underbelly *spotlights individual stories of people who have "fallen through the cracks" (drug addicts, abuse victims, veterans, etc.) to raise awareness and push forward social change.*

*Thank you to the people in my life, in college and outside of college, who celebrated my highs and kept me sane in my lows. You know who you are.*

*Thank you to those who were my professional colleagues at the time of this project being created for being dedicated to a open, healthy work environment. It is validating to work somewhere that actively supports employee well-being.*

*All project setup, interviews, interview processing, website development, and writeups were done by me. The burning block M graphic in the header was created by me; all other graphics are either UI elements from Material UI or plots generated from Google Sheets. I expect any fault in this project to be attributed to me and me only, and I expect any beneficial takeaways from this project to be credited to me and the relevant interviewee stories.*

*An anonymous narwhal helped me demo and revise my first iteration of my interview questions. Thank you, anonymous narwhal person!*
