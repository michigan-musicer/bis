*Above all else, my sincere thanks to everyone who shared their story with me. In hour-long conversations, you've taught me things I'd have taken years to learn on my own. I hope your words will help others too.*

*Thank you to the people in my life, in college and outside of college, who celebrated my highs and kept me sane in my lows. You know who you are.*

*Thank you to my therapist for helping me through my own experiences, as well as for offering informal guidance on this project.*

*Thank you to my current work colleagues for being dedicated to a open, healthy work environment. It is validating to be somewhere where these things can be talked about openly.*

*All project setup, interviews, interview processing, website development, and writeups were done by me. The burning block M graphic in the header was created by me; all other graphics are either UI elements from Material UI or plots generated from the `matplotlib` library in Python.*
