*For brevity, "burnout and imposter syndrome" will be abbreviated to BIS on this page.* 
*All pronouns are defaulted to they/them/theirs to protect interviewees that did not want to disclose a gender identity.*

Here I will present 10 of what I think are the most interesting qualitative observations from these interviews. 

For the most part, I am the only one coming up with these observations. (I discussed safe-to-discuss ideas with friends who knew about the project, as well as my therapist, but neither group participated in the writeup.) This means you should take these with a lot of salt; I've done my best to cite interviews and other sources where applicable, but I'm not a professional and I could be misinterpreting things very poorly.

Additionally, I recommend briefly looking at the [demographic info](/observations_demographic_quantitative) to get a sense of what this group of interviewees looks like. Keep in mind that **it consists predominantly of straight, Asian or Caucasian male students in engineering programs**.  

## 1. BIS comes in varying degrees

This is obvious when it's said out loud, but .

Almost every interviewee stated that they experienced both burnout and imposter syndrome at some point (not necessarily coinciding; see [quantitative observations](/observations_demographic_quantitative) for more).



Interviewees often indicated that they didn't know much about how much their peers experienced burnout and imposter syndrome (e.g. ). This is more noticeable with imposter syndrome than burnout; it may be that A. burnout is more severe and easier to notice even when someone is trying to hide it, B. burnout is easier to talk about with others than imposter syndrome, or something else. Some of these interviewees seemed to blame themselves for not asking, but there are enough people 


(these are trends and should be moved to quant)
## 2. Amount of work done does not necessarily predicate burnout

Many interviewees (list them here) defined burnout somewhere along the lines of "working too hard". The results from this project seem to indicate otherwise; 

## 4. GPA does not necessarily predicate imposter syndrome

A reasonable assumption to make is that high-performing students do not experience imposter syndrome because they have "proof" that they belong. I only collected one inidicator of performance, student GPA - but if we suppose that GPA is a reliable indicator, then we can resoundly reject this assumption.


## 3. BIS can be rooted in only academics or also in outside circumstances

Another takeaway that isn't surprising to say out loud, but worth noting. Ties in with #9. 

Usually, . My guess is that this depends on how closely tied academic performance is to one's self-esteem, which in turn comes from a web of personal factors.

## 6. Hints of a BIS "culture" at UofM?

. A few interviewees stated explicitly that 

There are a substantial number of high-achieving students who did not report feeling severe BIS during their studies. Some may be due to a lack of self-awareness, but from my own judgement, I think some of them did legitimately maintain a healthy balance.

Something that came up for me in conversations outside of this interview is that for people who are working very hard, the mere thought of BIS might be terrifying. Maybe there is something that they value or *want* to value more than the things BIS may impact, and they are willing to deny BIS around them in order to achieve that thing. Michigan does value hard work in its students, and I wonder if this applies to them.

## number. "Stress casualties" are relatively few

I'm borrowing "stress casualty" from this writeup on BioWare's development of Anthem written by Jason Schreier. In the context of that piece, "stress casualty"

From this sample, there aren't many . . My suspicion is that this says more about my network than it says about UofM as a whole - but at the same time, the university has a low rate of dropouts and transfers, so maybe to some extent this can be extrapolated.

My guess is that it's too early for many people to 

Finally, there are a . At least one interviewee noted physical symptoms of stress (Aye-Aye), 

## 5. Demographically "advantaged" students are the only ones who sometimes have an easier time

A large portion of the interviewee sample is . While a majority of these students do *not* report having an easy time with BIS, they comprise the majority of the students who *do* report having an easy time with BIS. 

A conversation with Anonymous Seal 

This is not universal. Anonymous Sugar Glider, a female computer science alum and incoming PhD precandidate, (Reported having a light experience or is that how I'm interpreting it compared to others?). They attributed this to them paying attention to mindfulness and self-care during their undergraduate career. Women are underrepresented in the computer science program and tend to experience more severe BIS due to some of the reasons mentioned above; .


## 7. Egotism

Dunning-Kruger

## 8. High school experiences can directly influence BIS at UofM, though not always

Many interviewees expressed enjoyment of their time in high school and/or pointed to it as the start of their interest in their major. However, (bad things can happen). There seem to be two ways this primarily manifests:

1. High school directly causes BIS before students even come to UofM (Zebrafish, Flamingo, Koala). For example, Anonymous Macaque reported 

(can come directly from trying too hard or from being a high performer in a small space and then succumbing to peer pressure)
What .

2. Traversing the jump between high school and college causes difficulties / stress for a student and incites BIS. This tends to cause imposter syndrome more than burnout, although both can be present (see , where )

Notably, many international students reported feeling like their high schools were not that rigorous compared to UofM. I think that the sample space here is too small to draw a conclusion (only 5 international students), 

As a last note, Anonymous Moose is unusual in that they indicate burnout as early as elementary school and imposter syndrome in high school - but neither feeling in college. According to their account, they experienced extensive burnout when learning programming at a young age, then  - which resulted in imposter syndrome in high school when they had a social expectation to perform well as a programmer.

## 9. Connection with other mental conditions unclear

Students separately reported a number of mental conditions alongside BIS, namely ADHD and depression. There may be more students who did not explicitly mention other issues, but may have intentionally or unintentionally implied them. I will only cite interviews that explicitly mention having a mental condition. 

## 10. COVID-19 had three distinct "tiers" of impact

Like many things from these interviews, COVID's impact is on an individual basis that can't 100%-accurately be divided into two groups. In general, though, I see three groups:

- Negative impact on BIS, often 
- Unrelated to BIS. 
- Positive impact on BIS. 

## Other comments:

- No one brought up their sexual orientation directly in an interview. Although the majority of interviewees who gave demographic info identified as heterosexual, some did idenitfy as an LGBTQ+ sexual orientation. There are a few reasons I think this might be the case:  
    - Maybe sexual orientation isn't related to BIS at all. This seems incredibly unlikely to me given how race and gender showed up in other interviews.
    - Maybe none of the interviewees are particularly public about their sexual orientation. BIS is very public, and sexual orientation tends to be something very private. The effects of one on the other may be siloed off from each other depending on how an individual separates their private life and public life.
    - Maybe interivewees genuinely feel supported at UofM with matters relating to sexual orientation. Ann Arbor is strongly liberal, which suggests it is friendly to LGBTQ+. (look into this more so you aren't talking out of your butthole) 
    - Something else I'm not considering.
- 
- Similarly, it's hard to say only based on the interviews in this project whether female students have more severe BIS compared to male students. At least one interviewee (Sugar Glider) , but she explicitly notes that rather than being a source of BIS, it motivated her to stand out and "be there" for other female students. There are almost definitely harsher stories from female students whom I never interviewed, especially considering the many sexual assault / misbehavior scandals at UofM within the last 5 years that predominantly targeted women. It is possible that UofM is a better environment for female students than some of the places cited in Clance's paper, and it
