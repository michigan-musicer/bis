*For brevity, "burnout and imposter syndrome" will be abbreviated to BIS on this page.* 
*All pronouns are defaulted to they/them/theirs to protect interviewees that did not want to disclose a gender identity.*

Here I will present 10 of what I think are the most interesting qualitative observations from these interviews. 

For the most part, I am the only one coming up with these observations. (I discussed safe-to-discuss ideas with friends who knew about the project, as well as my therapist, but neither group participated in the writeup.) This means you should take these with a lot of salt; I've done my best to cite interviews and other sources where applicable, but I'm not a professional and I could be misinterpreting things very poorly.

Additionally, I recommend briefly looking at the [demographic info](/observations_demographic) to get a sense of what this group of interviewees looks like. Keep in mind that **it consists predominantly of straight, Asian or Caucasian male students in engineering programs**.  

## 1. BIS is near-universal, but comes in varying degrees

*Although 41 interviewees were interviewed, current statistics are out of 39 because two interviewees have final reviews of their transcripts pending.*

The first point may be surprising. The latter is obvious when it's said out loud, but it's an important qualifier for the first point.

*37 / 39 (94.9%) of interviewees stated they experienced some degree of burnout at UofM at some point*. Meanwhile, *32 / 39 (82.1%) of interviewees stated they experienced some degree of imposter syndrome at some point*. However, many interviewees qualified their experiences with "not long-term", "kind of", or especially for imposter syndrome, "only in the beginning". These statements imply different experiences than, say, those of [Anonymous Zebrafish](/interview/zebrafish) or [Anonymous Flamingo](/interview/flamingo), where BIS appeared overwhelming.

When we filter out interviewees who said they only experienced mild burnout or imposter syndrome, we get the following: ***30 / 39 (76.9%) of interviewees stated they experienced something beyond mild burnout at some point***, and ***only 20 / 39 (51.3%) of interviewees stated they experienced something beyond mild imposter syndrome at some point***. If we want to attribute numbers to this sample, I think these ones more accurately represent the extent of these issues. It's harder to go more fine-grained with the severity without psychoanalyzing interviewees in detail, which is not feasible with the available data.

Exactly one interviewee ([Moose](/interview/moose)) stated they never experienced either burnout nor imposter syndrome at UofM; however, this individual stated they experienced these two things in earlier education (burnout, according to them, going back to learning programming in elementary school). Only one other individual ([Seal](/interview/seal)) stated they never experienced burnout at Michigan, which they attributed to deliberately taking lighter courseloads and mindfulness about their workload. 

Interestingly, not experiencing imposter syndrome at all is more common than not experiencing burnout at all in this sample. A common thread among those who do not experience it is coming into UofM with a strong ego - see point #8 for more detailed discussion. 

Regarding degrees of BIS: it really takes reading the interviews to get a sense of what the range is, but to compare extremes: [Aye-aye](/interview/aye-aye) and [ibis](/interview/ibis) both reported suffering physical side effects from academic stress. [Zebrafish](/interview/zebrafish) reported developing depression and anxiety from academic work, and some level of emotional distress is reported by [maine coon](/interview/mainecoon), [flamingo](/interview/flamingo), and others. My guess is that this extreme is even more populated than it appears here, because it's hard for people to talk about these experiences and not everyone is willing to open up. (I suspect a few of the people who declined my interview invitation were uncomfortable talking about the severity of their experiences with BIS.)

On the other hand, there *are* students who handle BIS in a healthy manner and are minimally affected. See [sugar glider](/interview/sugarglider), [lion](/interview/lion), and [white tiger](/interview/whitetiger) for what I think are good examples of individuals adapting in a healthy manner. In a related vein, many students do recover from BIS and seem to develop a healthier relationship with themselves as a result (see point #11). I think it is important to establish that it is possible to be mentally healthy at UofM, since negative extremes tend to dominate the conversation surrounding BIS.

## 2. Amount of work done does not necessarily predicate burnout

Many interviewees (list them here) defined burnout somewhere along the lines of "working too hard". The results from this project seem to indicate otherwise to some extent; although high work hours do tend to cause burnout, burnout can come from other sources, and one does not need to ovework themselves to reach a burnout point.

Extremely high work hours do tend to be *associated* with burnout; almost everyone who reports a very high number of working hours experiences burnout at some point. In many cases, the relationship between the volume of work and burnout is straightforward ([dolphin](/interview/dolphin), [beaver](/interview/beaver), [zebra](/interview/zebra), ...). According to some interviewees, though, hours don't always cause it directly. [Macaque](/interview/macaque) seems to suggest that they felt less burned out in graduate school because they were working on problems they enjoyed, despite them reporting working 80 to 100 hours a week in graduate school and 40 in undergraduate. [Salmon](/interview/salmon) noted that while heavy workload contributed to their burnout, lack of exercise was also a major factor. [Ibis](/interview/ibis) noted that a lack of a clear goal and vague expectations contributed a lot to their burnout early in their PhD; it seemed implied that they experienced less burnout later even though they often had heavy work weeks.

What is interesting is that even the interviewees who worked more "normal" hours, i.e. 40 or below, reported experiencing burnout. See [sheep](/interview/sheep), [shark](/interview/shark), [panda](/interview/panda) for examples. A common theme seems to be feeling a need to do work or not having enough progress on a goal or assignment; this often results in stress thinking about it. 

My guess is that working hours is not the same for many individuals as time spent not thinking about work. It's very difficult to escape UofM's environment because it occupies a central part of the local area. It may be that this environment becomes stifling when students need breaks.

Lastly, this observation may be a placebo based on the measurement used. As [ibis](/interview/ibis) pointed out in their interview, the average number of hours in a week may not be indicative of a person's working patterns. Some students may not work very much on assignments and then work very intensely on them close to the due date; perhaps this exacerbates burnout.

## 3. GPA does not necessarily predicate imposter syndrome

A reasonable assumption to make is that high-performing students do not experience imposter syndrome because they have "proof" that they belong. I only collected one inidicator of performance, student GPA - but if we suppose that GPA is a reliable indicator, then we can resoundly reject this assumption. See [dolphin](/interview/dolphin), [flamingo](interview/flamingo), [zebrafish](interview/zebrafish), and [sloth](interview/sloth) for a subset of examples of high GPAs (3.8 or above) that are still accompanied by imposter syndrome.

A reasonable counterassumption is that it depends on the people an individual is surrounded by; 3.8 can feel low if one has a lot of friends or colleagues with GPAs above 3.9. I think another more meaningful relationship is the amount of work put into one's tasks, charted against both expected payoff and actual payoff. I have no way to prove this with any data that can be converted into numbers, but a common theme from experiences with imposter syndrome is "I have to put in this much work for this result, when other people only have to put in *this* much work for *this* result" (e.g. [royal flycatcher](/interview/rfc), [aye-aye](/interview/aye-aye)). There are likely other compounding factors - see points #4, #7.

It is possible that imposter syndrome is even more pronounced among students with lower GPAs; the minimum GPA from demographic survey reports is a 3.2, and I do see imposter syndrome more frequently reported among students with lower GPAs in this sample. However, my guess is still that low GPA isn't guaranteed to be tied to imposter syndrome: a student may choose to prioritize things outside of academics, and it may not trigger imposter syndrome if they expect the grades that they get. This is only a guess that I cannot readily verify.

## 4. BIS can be rooted in only academics or also in outside circumstances

Another takeaway that isn't surprising to say out loud, but worth noting. 

Usually, . My guess is that this depends on how closely tied academic performance is to one's self-esteem, which in turn comes from a web of personal factors.

The tie-in between BIS and other mental health conditions is generally pretty clear. Students separately reported a number of mental conditions alongside BIS, namely ADHD and depression. There may be more students who did not explicitly mention other issues, but may have intentionally or unintentionally implied them. I will only cite interviews that explicitly mention having a mental condition: , , and all noted that their mental health conditions exacerbated their experience with BIS. This is not surprising. It does raise a question: do the mental health issues perhaps come from BIS, or does BIS come from the mental health issues? It certainly seems to become a cycle once it gets going, but the origin point is unclear.

## 5. Hints of a BIS "culture" at UofM?

UofM's atmosphere may be a contributor to student BIS. A few interviewees stated explicitly ([dog](interview/sloth), [macaque](interview/macaque)) that it feels like students have to go through it. Personally, I think there is some reason in the arguments that students "have to" go through it. As the dog points out, 

> Knowing how hard you are able to push yourself when the chips are down is valuable. I wouldn't recommend doing it as much as it happens at Michigan necessarily, but it is good to know that you can go to that place when you really absolutely have to.

And looking at macaque's point:

> My natural reaction to that is I would try to prevent the burnout - not explain to them what burnout is. But I think it's important to understand, right? But the only way you really understand it is by going through it, that's the key thing here. So I would say for me right now, it's like a key developmental experience because it develops both empathy and resiliency, and anti-fragility in a sense.

But this is contradicted by the number of high-achieving students who did not report feeling severe BIS during their studies; while they're not the majority, these people do exist. Some of those who did not feel severe BIS may be suffering a lack of self-awareness, but from my own judgement, I think many did legitimately maintain a healthy balance. There's some relevant discussion about degrees of BIS in point #1.

Something that came up for me in conversations outside of this interview is that for people who are working very hard, the mere thought of BIS might be terrifying. Maybe there is something that they value or *want* to value more than the things BIS may impact, and they are willing to deny BIS around them in order to achieve that thing. Michigan does value hard work in its students, and I wonder if those saying BIS is necessary are going through this fear.

More generally, attitudes towards BIS depend on one's social circle. There are clearly interviewees who did not suffer from BIS as badly as others (see point #1), but those who suffered higher degrees of BIS often made statements along the lines of "all my friends are going through it" or "everyone at Michigan is burned out" or even "if you're not suffering from burnout, you're doing something wrong". Everyone's experience and feelings are valid, but these statements are contradicted by those individuals that did not suffer severely from BIS. 

My guess is that people who are deeply affected by these issues and people who are *not* deeply affected by these issues will tend to repel each other; like attracts like. In particular, BIS may be a thorny mental health issue for people who do not feel it, but it may also be a point of connection and commiseration among people who do feel it. To be clear, this is dependent on the *degree* of BIS; almost everyone in this sample space has experienced BIS themselves to *some* degree but not necessarily a *severe* degree. 

On the other hand, many interviewees indicated that they didn't know much about how much their peers experienced burnout and imposter syndrome (e.g. [hamster](interview/hamster), [owl](interview/owl), [chicken](interview/chicken). This is more noticeable with imposter syndrome than burnout; it may be that A. burnout is more severe and easier to notice even when someone is trying to hide it, B. burnout is easier to talk about with others than imposter syndrome, or something else. Some of these interviewees seemed to blame themselves for not asking, but there are enough people who report this that it seems to be something else that's going on.

## 6. "Stress casualties" are relatively few

I'm borrowing "stress casualty" from [this writeup on BioWare's development of Anthem](https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964), written by Jason Schreier. BioWare is a game studio responsible for hits like the *Mass Effect* franchise, and *Anthem* is infamous for being such a poorly-performing game that it reversed the studio's reputation. According to a developer from that article,

> A "stress casualty" at BioWare means someone had such a mental breakdown from the stress they’re just *gone* for one to three months. Some come back, some don’t.

I'd like to adapt this term to refer to students who radically changed academic plans primarily due to stress, be it from BIS or other mental health conditions. This may refer to stress-induced gap years, major changes, major drops, dropping plans to pursue graduate school, etcetera. I will note that there are perfectly healthy reasons to do all of these things; I am looking specifically for cases of students doing these things because of mental health exacerbations. 

From this sample, there aren't many students who can be characterized this way. [Otter](/interview/otter) had to take an extra semester, [zebra](/interview/zebra) mentioned potentially quitting their sport, and [racoon](/interview/racoon) reports "existential burnout" and overall frustration with academic work. But most interviewees, even those suffering from more extreme cases of BIS, did not indicate that they deviated significantly from their plans. (Even in otter's case, a major drop was due to a loss of interest reportedly unrelated to BIS.) 

My suspicion is that this says more about my network than it says about UofM as a whole; I personally connected more with high-achieving students who would be unlikely to leave behind their work. But at the same time, the university has a low overall rate of dropouts and outward transfers. That may say something positive about the resiliency of the student body, or it may say something else. I do not know of data about major drops or changes offhand.

On the other hand, it may be too early in many people's careers to reach a stress casualty-level of BIS. Many interviewees who experienced severe BIS may end up becoming stress casualties later in their lives. Career switches are common (from what I hear), and BIS may contribute to that in an individual. This can especially be the case when companies force employees to work - a relevant term from the original Kotaku article is "crunch", which was company-mandated overtime for months on end. 

## 7. Demographically "advantaged" students are the only ones who sometimes have an easier time

A large portion of the interviewee sample is straight Asian American or Asian males in engineering. While a majority of these students do *not* report having an easy time with BIS, they comprise the majority of the students who *do* report having an easy time with BIS. 8 of the 10 students who experienced non-severe imposter syndrome fit this description (the other two were female). The 6 students who stated they never experienced imposter syndrome at UofM fit this description. The one interesting exception is that an African-American student is one of the two students who never experienced burnout; however, this specific student proceeded to bring up several salient points about the relationship between race and BIS.

A conversation with [Anonymous seal](/interview/seal) gives some insight into issues that particularly affect African American students - perhaps by extension other students who would classify as part of minority groups. They began by saying this:

> I come from metro Detroit. The city I came from is mostly African-Americans, and so coming into UofM, it's a different kind of imposter syndrome. It's honestly borderline even the same thing, but it's hard to look at a classroom and not see anyone who looks like you and then feel like you belong. You just kind of feel like, "I am not the same as everyone else", especially coming from a place where almost everyone's African-American. Coming into UofM and, you know, having to look for anyone who looks like you definitely can make you feel like you don't belong. I know that's the reason why so many people from my high school decided they didn't even want to come to this school in the first place. Because they knew that they'd be getting that feeling, and they just didn't wanna deal with it.

When asked if being conscious about their ethnicity took energy or attention away from academic matters:

> Away from academic matters? No. Away from just your energy, yeah. Especially now that things are online or at least partially online...when I'm at home, I'm not really thinking about that. But say I'm just walking around campus or I'm just doing my thing - sometimes it might come up in my mind. Especially as someone who's not only African-American, but particularly Nigerian, it definitely comes to mind. And I might think like I really don't know that many other Nigerians on campus, or I don't know that many other people who kind of share the same upbringing as myself. But because I do know many people who are from my high school, many of whom did have the same upbringing as myself, it doesn't really take too much energy for me, because I have those people who I can feel that kind of connection to. But I can definitely feel that if someone didn't have that support, it could feel taxing on them. It could build on whatever stress they're feeling, their academics, especially when you're not doing well.

Ultimately, in our back-and-forth discussion, seal agreed that it could be boiled down to 1. pressure to represent one's group, 2. smaller support network, and 3. "a nagging feeling of not wanting to perpetuate any stereotypes". I recommend reading their full interview for more details; I found it to be an engaging and eye-opening discussion.

In a similar vein, [zebra](/interview/zebra) briefly noted that they believed imposter syndrome was worse among their female associates than their male associates. This didn't turn into as long of a conversation, but it's still a good note considering that imposter syndrome was first thought to be a phenomenon in high-performing women in academia and professional work.

Worsened BIS among less represented groups is not universal. Anonymous [sugar glider](/interview/sugarglider), a female computer science alum and incoming PhD precandidate, seemed to have a relatively light experience with BIS. They attributed this to them paying attention to mindfulness and self-care during their undergraduate career. Women are underrepresented in the computer science program and tend to experience more severe BIS due to some of the reasons mentioned above; however, this student explicitly mentioned seeing a lack of women in their AP computer science class and becoming motivated to "be there" for other women who might be intimidated by it.

## 8. What relationship does egotism have with BIS?

I'm using "egotism" as an umbrella term for arrogance, confidence, resilience, self-centeredness...The relationship between egotism and BIS is complicated and I think depends on how healthy that egotism is. This analysis in particular I think requires followup conversations with each of these interviewees I'm about to cite to really be satisfying - what I'm about to say may be more spurious than these other observations.

Several students called themselves arrogant ([octopus](/interview/octopus), [ibis](/interview/ibis)) when talking about their resistance to imposter syndrome. I'm not sure if this highlights arrogance as much as the tendency among some interviewers to project their experiences onto others or make judgements about others; in my opinion, see for example [racoon](/interview/racooon), [moose](/interview/moose), [zebrafish](/interview/zebrafish) and [macaque](/interview/macaque), although I think it's worth noting that macaque self-corrected later in the interview. Ibis, zebrafish, and macaque all reported experiencing non-mild imposter syndrome at some point, while racooon, octopus and moose reported never feeling it at UofM. I will say again that this is a spurious interpretation and that I don't think these interviewees are bad people - I'm just judging based on either what they said directly or the tone of their interviews.

When egotism leans more negative like this, it is possible that it is projection of a lack of self-confidence. This internal conflict can lead to worsened imposter syndrome as the difference between the public persona and the private, internal persona widens. The need to keep up an image or "fake it till you make it" exacerbates these feelings and can make imposter syndrome feel worse than before. I would be more supsicious of this in those who said they never experienced imposter syndrome than in those who say they did; acknowledging imposter syndrome is likely the first step to building up that self-confidence once more. 

There is a more positive egotism that leans more towards a healthy self-confidence, visible in [lion](/interview/lion), [sugar glider](/interview/sugarglider), and [sloth](/interview/sloth), among others. Lion reported never feeling imposter syndrome, while sugar glider and sloth both report that imposter syndrome is still an active problem for them. However, these three interviewees showcase what I interpret as a more balanced self-awareness that makes them *sound* healthier than the six interviewees above. Again, maybe this is a spurious interpretation, and I wouldn't want the three of them to become complacent reading this.

[Human](/interview/human) is an interesting case of someone who doesn't believe they qualify as a high performer, but doesn't feel that they experience imposter syndrome. Specifically, 

> I definitely have never felt like I was afraid of being exposed as fraud. I'm a slow learner, but I try to feel like everything I learn is well-grounded in a sense, so I don't think I'd ever be afraid of someone asking me something and I'm just like having to pass it off - like I know about it, but I don't actually know it at all. I mean, I do that in casual conversations sometimes, but not in any sort of severe sense.

Where does this person's ego lie?

Lastly, [ibis](/interview/ibis) brought up the Dunning-Kruger effect as a counterbalance to their own egotism. Essentially, the less skilled someone is, the more confident they are in their abilities; and as one becomes more skilled, confidence goes down until eventually they reach a point where they can say, "I don't know everything, but I know that I know *this much*." One might hypothesize that a more negative egotism leans on the left side of Dunning-Kruger and the more positive egotism leans on the right side of Dunning-Kruger. But that's not likely to be an absolute.

## 9. High school experiences can directly influence BIS at UofM, though not always

Many interviewees expressed enjoyment of their time in high school and/or pointed to it as the start of their interest in their major. However, high school also serves as a starting point for BIS for many students. There seem to be two ways this primarily manifests:

1. High school directly causes BIS before students even come to UofM ([zebrafish](/interview/zebrafish), [flamingo](/interview/flamingo), [koala](/interview/koala)). For example, koala reported feeling behind other students during college application season, and zebrafish . 

BIS here may come directly from trying too hard in high school, or from being a high performer in a small space and then succumbing to peer pressure. It definitely seems to depend on the high school. In particular, competitive New York City public schools came up frequently in stories of BIS. Flamingo and koala are from the NYC system, as is [macaque](/interview/macaque) (who focused more on failure to live up to expectations in terms of college applications). The most unusual point was how aware these NYC students were of BIS before coming to UofM.

2. Traversing the jump between high school and college causes difficulties / stress for a student and incites BIS. This tends to cause imposter syndrome more than burnout, although both can be present (see [gorilla](/interview/gorilla), [aardvark](/interview/aardvark), [fox](/interview/fox), [sugar glider](/interview/sugarglider)...).

Two interviewees, [bear](/interview/bear) and [jaguar](/interview/jaguar), report coming from a relatively weak high school - incidentally, neither of their schools had physics. Both report a subsequent struggle to adapt in college. I cannot say precisely for gorilla, aardvark, sugar glider, and fox; but it is reasonable that coming in from a weaker high school causes more hardships in that transition period.

As a last note, [moose](/interview/moose)'s is unusual in that they indicate burnout as early as elementary school and imposter syndrome in high school - but neither feeling in college. According to their account, they experienced extensive burnout when learning programming at a young age, then began to flourish later in K-12 - which resulted in imposter syndrome in high school when they failed to meet a social expectation to perform. 

## 10. COVID-19 had three distinct "tiers" of impact

Like many things from these interviews, COVID's impact is on an individual basis that can't 100%-accurately be divided into distinct categories. In general, though, I see three groups:

- Negative impact on BIS, often relating to social isolation or lack of motivation. e.g.
- Unrelated to BIS. e.g.
- Positive impact on BIS, often relating to additional free time or taking advantage of pass/fail policies. e.g. 

These are relatively natural groups and it's not surprising that different students have different reactions to COVID. I think that the negative impacts of COVID are the ones that are discussed most, however, which may make it uncomfortable to acknowledge those who were unaffected or positively impacted by changes brought about during the pandemic years. It does, of course, make sense to focus on those who are struggling and provide help to them specifically over those who are handling things fine.

## 11. It may end, it may not

Many report a light at the end of the BIS tunnel. From [owl](/interview/owl):

> Right now I’m working in kind of a stress-free spot...It's all temporary. After we get out into a good spot, then...Things will improve.

From [flamingo](/interview/flamingo):

> I think in the past couple months, I've made some very wise decisions that have prepared me for senior year in a good way. I've been not in New York for three years at this point. And now I just took a remote internship where I can be at home, hang out with friends and family. I don't have to commute, I can work on a more safe and healthy way of life. I dropped all the project teams that I was doing but not enjoying due to COVID or, you know, the content. And I've been cutting away what I either don't wanna do or what I realize I can't do.

From [elephant](/interview/elephant):

> Even though it was hard for me at first, it really motivated me. And after taking a class, I felt like I learned so much, and it's been helping me with internships and even jobs now. So I mean, I really enjoyed it overall.

This isn't always the case. [Cat](/interview/cat) still reflects on feeling like they declined as a result of their college experience:

> It just took that one decision and the result of that, and I very quickly stumbled down and thankfully was able to identify a lot of what was going on, um, and start pulling myself out of it. I'm still continuing, I feel, to pull myself out of it. I still am constantly wondering, am I spending my time wisely? Am I being disciplined? I have huge discipline difficulties now. I'm constantly second-guessing myself, and I'm constantly all over the place. I'm just now trying to find - like I've constantly been someone who creates calendars. I always create a schedule, but that schedule gets blown through in three days and completely ignored. And I think it's stemmed from this, where it got to the point where I decided, "Nothing that I do matters, so I'm just gonna sit back and let it ride". That was kind of the mentality that grew out of that sharp drop-off.

[Giraffe](/interview/giraffe) suggested that imposter syndrome in particular got worse the higher in education they went:

> You get more burnout in undergrad for sure, and more imposter syndrome as you get higher in your education.

[Macaque](/interview/macaque) was perhaps the most explicit about their expectations in regards to future BIS:

> I'm sure I will go through burnout again at some point in my life. That's a normal thing for me. But to be able to recover is the hard question. <laugh> I don't know.

It would be nice to think that BIS is a solvable problem that might never show up again, and for some people perhaps that is where they will go and that is all they will need. The feeling I get from people who *don't* feel that way is that there's something they want, and to get that something, going through BIS is an acceptable cost. Maybe that something is in the past, something they regret not getting and they wish they paid that cost to get; maybe it's in the future, and they're planning on putting themselves under the duress of BIS to achieve that something.

At the end of the day, BIS is a very individual problem, and this aspect, like all of its aspects, depends on who's experiencing it. My hope isn't to provide a cookie cutter solution to BIS that will work for everyone; it's to observe how young people are navigating these problems in the hopes that it'll help other young people chart their course. If *Brilliant Little Fires* has helped you in that regard, I'm satisfied.

## Other comments:

- It should be obvious, but I would note that BIS is not a phenomenon exclusive to UofM. Other university students I'm sure experience BIS, and most of the recent discussion around it has actually been in the workplace.
- No one brought up their sexual orientation directly in an interview. Although the majority of interviewees who gave demographic info identified as heterosexual, some did idenitfy as an LGBTQ+ sexual orientation. There are a few reasons I think this might be the case:  
    - Maybe sexual orientation isn't related to BIS at all. This seems incredibly unlikely to me given how race and gender were relevant to BIS in other interviews.
    - Maybe none of the interviewees are particularly public about their sexual orientation. BIS is very public, and sexual orientation tends to be something very private. The effects of one on the other may be siloed off from each other depending on how an individual separates their private life and public life.
    - Maybe interivewees genuinely feel supported at UofM with matters relating to sexual orientation. Ann Arbor is strongly liberal, which suggests it is friendly to LGBTQ+. But I don't know enough about LGBTQ+ to say confidently. 
    - Something else I'm not considering.
- Graduate school *seems* to be more difficult than undergraduate for most graduate students, going based off of hours and qualitative statements. But many master's students coming from a UofM undergraduate report similar or lighter hours in graduate school.
- There's some interesting notes about the international student experience that I haven't taken the time to write up: informally, adaptation to a new culture and language can accentuate BIS. It doesn't seem 100% related to an individual's academic abilities - there's a different problem going on there altogether.
- Just a tally of everyone's hours worked would be interesting. Something I might do later.
